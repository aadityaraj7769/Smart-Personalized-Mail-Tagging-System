            "But, if you were \"grading out\" the play, would you be giving out many \"10s?\"\n",
            "If Tom Brady weren't, well, Tom Brady, how much grief would he have caught for the bonehead safety?\n",
            "And let's just focus on two passes. First, the interception on the deep attempt to Gronkowski. The play had all the makings to land itself on Super Bowl highlight films forever. First, Brady, not a scrambler, manages to duck under and elude a heavy Giant pass-rush. He sets his feet, scans the field and then heaves it deep. Tell the truth, didn't you expect to see a wide open Patriot either streaking to the end zone or waiting all alone at the five?Instead, what we saw was a well-covered receiver (Gronkowski) having no chance of fighting back through Chase Blackburn, possibly the largest man (6'3\" and 247 lbs) to ever be the deepest defender on an NFL play, for a badly underthrown (and intercepted) pass.\n",
            "\n",
            "But most of America's opinion was influenced by talking head, Cris Collinsworth, who declared that Gronkowski didn't \"help out\" Brady!\n",
            "America heard the same ridiculous sort of comment when Brady missedWes Welkerwith just over four minutes left in the game on a play that at minimum would have retained possession for the Patriots, likely would have resulted in at least a field goal and may have led to a game-clinching touchdown.\n",
            "Was the pass catchable? Yes. But 999 out of 1000 times, as Collinsworth claimed, or Welker graciously stated after the game? Not a chance.\n",
            "Brady left the pass short and behind Welker. This wasn't an intentional \"back shoulder\" pass. Welker had room to the middle of the field as the Giants safety was late in reacting.\n",
            "It was simply a bad pass on a play that might have clinched a Super Bowl victory for New England.\n",
            "When I stated my opinion that Brady had played poorly to my favorite bartender the day after the game, he said, \"But he completed 16 passes in a row!\"  And he's right, he did.\n",
            "But Tom Brady came up short on the day the very best are supposed to excel.\n",
            "Eli Manningdidn't excel, either. What he did was win.\n",
            "The Giants offense found the end zone early, thanks to the negation of a New England interception for having 12 men on the field (a penalty the Giants were also guilty of on the next-to-last play of the game, giving the Patriots five yards that helped Brady throw a perfect Hail Mary into the end zone on the last play).\n",
            "And, to their credit, they found it late.\n",
            "If this had been that aforementioned November game between Cincinnati and Tennessee, it would have already been forgotten.\n",
            "But, it was on the biggest stage for the grandest prize in all of sports, and thus goes down as a \"memorable\" Super Bowl.\n",
            "What I'll always remember is it was the strangest way I've ever seen a team get to 21.\n",

            "Anyone remember what you felt like after the opening drive?\n",
            "I’m struggling to think of a recent Seahawks performance quite as messy as this. There were games in the Mora era where the Seahawks just flat out bailed after going behind early, and there were some heavy defeats in the early Carroll days. This is much more frustrating. The team should be beyond the kind of basic errors we saw today. The Rams didn’t score an offensive touchdown, relied on long-range field goals and surrendered a big touchdown drive to start the game. And they still won comfortably.\n",
            "This is a defensive unit that consistently flirts with elite status. Man for man, it’s a group that matches up to any in the league. So why can’t they defend third and long? Time and time again, drives against the Cowboys and Rams have been extended after the opponent reached 3rd and 10 or greater. It’s a complete head scratcher. Without going through each play today or against Dallas, it’s hard to work out what the problem is. It’s not an issue defending the screen, something we saw regularly in 201 to extend drives on third and long. It isn’t a draw play or underneath throw that is gashing the team. It appears to be pretty basic – Bradford/Romo dropped back and found open receivers in man-to-man coverage. Are the Seahawks using extra guys in the secondary? You presume so. What’s happening here? If the defense is going to live up to rising expectations, they have to get it done on third and long.\n",
            "Penalties are killing the Seahawks. The coaches’ stress discipline so much, so why is this continuing to happen? Breno Giacomini is a walking 15-yard penalty. It seems like certain players are taking risks pretty much on every drive, chipping after the whistle or making unnecessary moves towards an opponent. The false start issues didn’t re-appear today but they were replaced by a few other costly flags. The message isn’t getting through here. Some are blaming the coaches, but they preach itsomuch. Eventually the players are just going to have to engage their brains or take a seat on the sidelines. It’s far too costly and Seattle remains one of the most penalised teams in the NFL.\n",
            "I’m not going to blame Russell Wilson too much for this defeat. There is a ‘but…’ however. Of the three interceptions he had, one pass should’ve been caught by a receiver and a tight end tripped up leading to another. The other pick came on a cornerback blitz that he really should’ve done a better job handling. Janoris Jenkins moved inside and left a receiver open to the left, but Wilson checked to two options on the right, was hit by Jenkins and the ball was picked. React, get the ball to the left quickly and take what’s on offer. The concern I have with Wilson is a pretty big one. In four starts so far he hasreallystruggled to sit in the pocket and make plays. On the penultimate drive he had pretty good protection on third down, but still panicked too quickly and left the pocket. He was sacked scrambling around trying to find space to throw.\n",
            "Time and time again he’s leaving the pocket too quickly. If Wilson is ever going to make it as a long term starter, he has to be able to sit in the pocket and make reads. Right now he simply isn’t doing that. I’m not sure whether replacing him is the answer because you might end up switching one issue for another. For every play Wilson gets panicky and leaves the pocket, there’s a play where his superior mobility is a factor. It’s harsh to judge a rookie too early but I think we’re moving into the territory now where we don’t assume Wilson is the answer. For me, the Seahawks have made their bed and need to keep rolling with the guy and hope he improves. But for the first time this season the thought of going back to scouting quarterbacks crossed my mind.\n",
            "Play calling is still a frustrating issue. Seattle ran the ball well all day and with the score at 16-13 were in the red zone at 3rd and 2. They called a QB draw. If you’re going to run, then run with Marshawn Lynch. If you’re going to throw, then throw the ball. Calling a QB draw was beyond getting cute. It reminded me of the option play on Monday against Green Bay (also on third down). Why get so intricate like that? It’s not a trick play, it’s not just solid football and let them stop you. I don’t understand either call.\n",
            "On the whole the Seahawks are playing a brand of football that basically compensates for a total lack of a passing game. When the defense, special teams and run game click – they look like a very good team. Yet if one area doesn’t quite have a great day, another unit has to compensate to make up for it. The passing game cannot do that yet. What’s more, they don’t score cheap points. Getting a touchdown seems like a chore for this team – the red zone a place of dread. The passing game needs a complete overhaul and review in the off-season – it cannot be a complimentary piece. By all means create a dominating ground game – but it cannot be your entire identity. Balance must be found.\n",
            "In 2010, Matt Hasselbeck had only 12 touchdowns and ranked way down the list for QB rating. He had 17 turnovers. Taravaris Jackson had just 14 touchdowns, 13 picks and again was way down the list for QB rating. Russell Wilson appears set to make it an unwelcome hat-trick of bad production for the position.\n",
            "The Seahawks are a fortunate 2-2 but look more like the 1-3 team they probably should be. This could be a frustrating year overall, with some annoying defeats like this one and some equally tense victories down the road. But it still looks like a team that is going to be around eight wins. Maybe they go 7-9 again, maybe they edge to a winning record at 9-7? Everyone can see that the team is improving in certain areas, but if it’s going to break from mediocrity and become a contender the Seattle Seahawksneeda passing game. The front office has to make it as much of a priority as the running game, offensive line, pass rush and secondary – all areas that have improved since the Pete Carroll era began.\n",
            "List of priorities for the off season:\n",
            "1. Passing game\n",
            "End.\n",
            "This guy is playing pretty well right now...\n",
            "Two games kind of stand out this weekend. Firstly, Baylor’s defense did a great job boosting Geno Smith’s Heisman campaign. Then Georgia and Tennessee, perhaps inspired by the efforts of WVU and BU, decided they’d give the defense a weekend off too.\n",
            "Geno Smith gaining momentum\n",
            "No prizes for guessing who’s the Heisman front-runner at this stage. Geno Smith scored eight passing touchdowns against Baylor, recorded 656 yards, completed 45 passes and even added 31 yards rushing. After four games he has 21 total touchdowns and zero turnovers. Tougher games are on the horizon and he’s going to have to avoid the occasional off-day he experienced last year (see: Syracuse) but there’s no doubting he’s a talented quarterback with pro-potential. His deep accuracy has always been pretty good and he’s above average in most of the key areas – arm strength, athleticism, accuracy and field IQ. He does everything pretty well and when you look at him physically, you wonder if he’s only scratching the surface of his potential. Realistically he could improve his upper body strength without getting too big to improve his throwing velocity even further.\n",
            "In terms of the draft, perhaps the most important thing isn’t so much how well Smith is playing – but the way other quarterbacks aren’t. Matt Barkley hasn’t been at his best in the last two weeks. Tyler Wilson’s season is imploding at Arkansas. Logan Thomas lost again today and won’t declare. Aaron Murray looks sharp but lacks the physical tools to make him a top pick. Right now Smith is the only guy with any momentum. Teams will realise he’s playing in a prolific scheme, but it’s the same scheme that pushed soon-to-be 29-year-old quarterback Brandon Weeden into the first round. If he can keep winning and keep up the production, Smith will be in contention to be the first quarterback off the board.\n",
            "Of course, it helps having a pair of talented wide outs. Tavon Austin again looked spectacular – recording 14 catches and 215 yards plus a couple of scores. In the last two games he has 27 catches, five touchdowns and 394 yards. Austin could be Smith’s answer to Kendall Wright and certainly the RGIII-to-Wright connection helped both players in the 2012 draft. For all Austin’s lack of size, he’s an electric playmaker. Don’t sleep on the other WVU wide-out Stedman Bailey. He also lacks size at around 5-10, but it’s hard to ignore a 13-catch, 303 yard performance including five touchdowns. Crazy numbers.\n",
            "And while we’re talking about receivers, let’s also touch on Terrance Williams at Baylor. We highlighted him over the summer and he’s started the year well – culminating in an even better yardage display than Bailey this afternoon. He had 17 catches against WVU, 314 yards and two touchdowns. He has 667 yards and six touchdowns in four games. There might not be a Julio Jones or A.J. Green among the 2013 receiving class, but there’s a fair amount of depth.\n",
            "Georgia’s defense struggles, apart from one player\n",
            "Alec Ogletree has missed games at Georgia for a variety of reasons. He missed a game in 2010 through suspension after being arrested and charged with misdemeanor theft stemming from an incident involving a stolen scooter helmet (OK….). He missed six games in 2011 with a broken foot. Georgia suspended him again this year for four games after he failed a drugs test. This is a guy with baggage. This is also a guy who can play the linebacker position very, very well.\n",
            "On a night where defense was an afterthought, Ogletree stood out. More so than superstar pass rusher Jarvis Jones who was a non-factor, or the massive interior presence of Jonathan Jenkins. He led the team in tackles on the night and played a solid game without error. He also flashed great athleticism, charging from sideline-to-sideline and tipping a pass at full stretch into the hands of safety Damian Swann. The off-field concerns are a major red flag, especially for a guy who will likely be expected to make a lot of defensive calls at linebacker. Even so, it’s hard to ignore him when he plays like this. Put the guy in a good locker room and he’s going to be a great pro.\n",
            "Jarvis Jones struggled to have an impact and it’ll raise concerns that others have voiced in the past. He’s had dominating games in his career, but rarely on the big occasions. When his team needed plays on defense he couldn’t avoid double teams or find a way to get involved. Tennessee has one of the best overall offensive lines in college football with legit pro-talent, but Jones still needs to flash in a game like this. He’ll have plenty of other opportunities in 2012 to prove this was just an off-night.\n",
            "On the other side of the ball, Aaron Murray continues to impress. He had an interception on a tipped pass, but he looked assured apart from that. I particularly liked his decision making and execution shown in tough spots – at one stage he wanted to throw deep down the right but rejected it, moved inside and threw a dart into a tight window. The receiver didn’t get the pass but it was a perfect throw and decision. He’s not a bad athlete but he’s more mobile than athletic. He hasn’t got ideal physical attributes but he has plenty of zip when required, but he’s probably maxed out in that sense. Can he be effective at the next level? It’s something I’m still trying to work out, but I wouldn’t rule it out.\n",
            "It was an odd night for Tennessee’s offense, lurching between elite and nightmarish equally. They ended the game with three Tyler Bray turnovers. Bray is a natural passer who looks really impressive at times, throwing bombs around the field. He’s got a bit of Brock Osweiler to his game with an awkward throwing motion and he’s tall and thin. He’s much more erratic than Osweiler, who actually had a good college career until the wheels came off at Arizona State. The best way to describe it is – he has the Jay Cutler disease. Natural passer, looks great on form – but he has moments in a game where he falls apart and he can’t get it back. Cutler, technically, has always been on a different level because Bray is slingy with his release, he gets into difficult throwing positions due to bad footwork and he too often steps backwards before throwing off-balance. He won’t get away with that when scouts watch the tape.\n",
            "Receiver Cordarrelle Patterson showed the best and worst of his game on the night. In the first half he had a horrendous drop on a deep pass, beating his man and needing only to catch the ball for a long touchdown. The concentration dipped, he dropped the football and it was a huge error. Last week he practically disappeared from the Akron game after a mistake led to a pick-six, and the same almost happened again tonight. He had just two catches – both in the dying embers of the game – for 31 yards in safe coverage. And just when you’re ready to write the guy off as a possible high pick, he runs a reverse to the house for a 46 yard touchdown. He’s an extreme playmaker with the ball in his hands, physically he’s superior to any other 2013 eligible receiver. And yet you still feel he’s a long way away from being an effective pro. He’s not a mature guy and maybe that has an impact on the little mental mistakes? Even so, he has incredible potential. He’s just a risky project.\n",
            "It wasn’t a good night for Justin Hunter, who was ignored for most of the game. He ended with three catches for 46 yards. Tonight’s showing won’t convince anyone he’s back to 100% after recovering from a serious knee injury.\n",
            "Elsewhere…\n",
            "We highlighted Missouri defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson this week – and he was at it again today. He had nine tackles, forced a fumble and recorded a sack against Central Florida. He’s a classic three technique prospect and will be rising up a lot of draft boards. One to definitely watch for the Seahawks.\n",
            "Logan Thomas struggled again and almost certainly won’t declare for 2013. The Virginia Tech quarterback had two picks, two total touchdowns and 242 passing yards completing 17/30. But most importantly, he couldn’t lead a talented VT team past Cincinnati and it’s now two recent defeats to opponents he should be beating. One of the big disappointments of 2012 so far.\n",
            "Clemson receiver DeAndre Hopkins did his best to keep up with some of the crazy numbers today. He caught 11 passes for 197 yards and a touchdown as the Tigers won 45-31 at Boston College. Running back Andre Ellington had 25 carries for 131 yards and a score.\n",
            "Keenan Allen is still suffering with middling quarterback play at California. He had a big 44 yard pass play in defeat to Arizona State, but he ended with just four catches for 79 yards and a touchdown. The combine will determine his draft fate.\n",
            "Tyler Wilson won’t be sending a Christmas card to Bobby Petrino this year. Arkansas is a complete shambles – the latest example a 58-10 defeat to Texas A&M. Wilson threw two bad picks and finished with 29/59 passing, 373 yards and a score. On the plus side, Knile Davis looked sharp on the touchdown pass, sprinting through tackles and looking somewhere back to his best. Unfortunately he also fumbled twice. Receiver Cobi Hamilton kept up his good form with 11 catches for 162 yards. Aggies defensive end Damontre Moore looked superb – he was a terror off the edge in the parts of the game I saw, forcing a fumble that was returned for a touchdown and getting a sack. I want to see more of this guy because he has first round potential.\n",
            "North Carolina defensive tackle Sylvester Williams had another sack in a blow-out victory over Idaho. He now has 4.5 sacks in five games. He’s an older guy due to his JUCO roots, but he’s still one to watch. Underrated.\n",
            "I’ll be watching Ole Miss vs Alabama on Sunday, prior to Seattle’s game at St. Louis.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you’re watching a game or a prospect this weekend… let us know about it.\n",
            "Aaron Murray is probably Russell Wilson's biggest fan this year\n",
            "I’m going to start creating an open thread each Saturday so if you’re watching a game or a prospect and want to throw some thoughts down – please do. I’ll be watching two games this week:\n",
            "Tennessee at Georgia\n",
            "The Bulldogs are intense this year and determined to have an impact in the SEC. They feel it’stheirtime. The defense is filled with NFL talent and Aaron Murray is putting together a solid Heisman campaign. It’s another opportunity for Jarvis Jones (DE, LB) to show what he can do as a pass rusher and playmaker – Jones could be the top 2013 eligible player at any position and the #1 pick next year. Jonathan Jenkins has tremendous potential as a nose tackle and he’s well supported by the underrated Abry Jones on the defensive line. Linebacker Alec Ogletree hasn’t received much hype after missing the start of the season, but he’s also a NFL talent. Defensive backs Shawn Williams and Baccari Rambo are also worth watching.\n",
            "Aaron Murray is really hoping Russell Wilson blossoms as a starter this year. At around 6-1 Murray is taller than Wilson but will suffer from the same level of scepticism. At times he looks like a fine prospect, dissecting a defense like a surgeon while also showing enough athletic ability to make plays outside of the pocket. Then there are other games where he struggles – badly. So far he’s had a very good 2012, but to get around a lack of ideal physical attributes he’s going to need guys like Wilson to step up. If he does, and if Murray continues to perform, he could be a first or second round pick. It’s still a big ‘if’ at this stage. Wilson isn’t just playing to prove critics wrong in Seattle, he’s playing to change the way people think about quarterbacks.\n",
            "Tennessee’s best prospects are on offense and the passing game, so it’ll be good to see how they match up against the talented Georgia unit. Tyler Bray is a gun-slinger without ideal mechanics or footwork. Reports also say he’s not the most natural leader – and it’s hard to forget his first bowl game as a freshman, which included tears after mistakes and a bizarre throat-slitting celebration every time he scored a touchdown. He is a natural passer though and can only boost his stock by winning games like this. He can’t complain about the options he has at receiver. Despite losing Da’Rick Rogers (who is doing pretty well at Tennessee Tech, as it happens), he’s inherited Cordarrelle Patterson. Last week was a down week for Patterson, who did a bad job on a route leading to a pick six against Akron and his quarterback didn’t let him forget it. He’s too much of a talent to ignore in this one though, so expect Patterson to get a lot of looks. He’s big, fast, strong and a playmaker. He’ll play opposite Justin Hunter who is still looking pretty consistent after returning from a serious knee injury. He’s also perhaps the most complete receiver eligible for 2013.\n",
            "Ole Miss at Alabama\n",
            "This is probably going to be a very easy victory for the Crimson Tide – Ole Miss’ best draft prospect might be punter Tyler Campbell. Alabama has no such concerns. A.J. McCarron is an underrated quarterback who benefits from a dominating ground game anchored by brilliant guard prospect Chance Warmack and versatile center Barrett Jones. I don’t expect to learn much from this game, rather than sit back and simply enjoy watching the best college team dominate. Aside from the names mentioned, ‘Bama also has the best 2013 eligible cornerback in Dee Milliner, a solid defensive tackle in Jesse Williams and an athletic linebacker in C.J. Mosley. Watch the game, have a look at a handful of players who will be significant pro’s at the next level.\n",
            "Seahawks scouting\n",
            "According to Chris Steuber, the Seahawks will have representatives at this weekend’s Baylor vs West Virginia game. Could they be keeping tabs on Tavon Austin? He had 13 catches for WVU last weekend and three touchdowns. Steuber also reports Seattle will have guys at the Marshall vs Purdue game (Marshall – Aaron Dobson WR, Purdue – Kawann Short DT) and Oregon vs Washington State (Oregon – Dion Jordan DE, Washington State – Travis Long DE, Marquess Wilson WR).\n",

            "Some interesting numbers fromAdvanced NFL Stats…\n",
            "– Sidney Rice, earning $8.2m in 2012, has been targeted 15 times in three games. That’s good enough for 58th in NFL receivers, behind Andrew Hawkins, Michael Jenkins and Dexter McCluster. Rice has caught eight of those passes, 40% of which are considered downfield attempts.\n",
            "– Golden Tate is 7oth on the list with 11 targets but missed the opening game against Arizona. 55% of his targets have been downfield throws, second highest in the NFL.\n",
            "– Braylon Edwards has nine targets with five catches. Not a single one of those targets was considered a downfield throw.\n",
            "– Only two tight ends have seen less targets than Zach Miller and Anthony McCoy (both thrown at eight times). In comparison, Jeff Cumberland of the New York Jets has 15 targets.\n",
            "– Russell Wilson has attempted 75 passes, less than every active quarterback in the NFL not named Kevin Kolb or John Skelton. The two Arizona quarterbacks combined have thrown nine more passes than Wilson.\n",
            "– Only one running back has rushed more times than Marshawn Lynch – Houston Adrian Foster. Lynch (72 carries) and Foster (79 carries) are well clear of the chasing pack. Third most active running back – Doug Martin – has 63 carries. Maurice Jones-Drew is fourth with 59 carries.\n",
            "Conclusion: How can we judge if this quarterback and group of receivers are good enough if the passing game is taking such an exaggerated back seat to the running game?\n",
            "I ask this question only because people are either a.) saying Seattle’s greatest need is at receiver and b.) that it’s time for Matt Flynn to start at quarterback. I’ve made the point about receivers myself, but I’m starting to question it. How can we come to that conclusion on such little evidence? Likewise, I’m not sure what you expect to see from Flynn in such an unbalanced offense?\n",
            "Let’s start with the receivers.\n",
            "In 2009 Sidney Rice was 4th in the NFL for receiving yards and yards per game. Only Andre Johnson, Wes Welker and Miles Austin were ranked higher. Sure, the Vikings had the good version of Brett Favre that year. But Rice, when healthy, showed he can be a truly effective NFL receiver. He was a big-play threat too, with only Vincent Jackson and Robert Meachem earning a higher yards per target average. Nobody has ever questioned Rice’s quality, just his ability to stay healthy. Considering he’ll earn $9.7m in both 2013 and 2014, the team will need to feel he’s having a big enough impact to justify that salary. When he signed the deal, Pete Carroll and/or John Schneider clearly felt he could be a defining piece of the offense.\n",
            "Zach Miller’s cap hit in 2012 is $7m and it’ll rise to a humongous $11m in 2013. By the end of the 2012 season Miller will have cost the Seahawks $10m. Another way of looking at it is $1m per three catches and zero touchdowns. He’s played 18 games, most of which he’s acted as a third offensive tackle. Before he moved to Seattle, he was Oakland’s top receiver by some distance in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Again, when he signed the deal, Pete Carroll and/or John Schneider clearly felt he could be a defining piece of the offense.\n",
            "Golden Tate has cost Seattle just $2.06m in salary to date, with the final year of his rookie contract worth $880k in 2013. He also cost the Seahawks an important second round pick in the 2010 draft – Carroll and Schneider’s first with the team. Interesting fact – had the Seahawks not traded for Charlie Whitehurst, they would’ve had the opportunity to draft Rob Gronkowski, Jimmy Graham or Aaron Hernandez. Even with the Whitehurst trade, they had a shot at Graham and Hernandez. Tate has so far produced five career touchdowns for the Seahawks, 13 less than Graham and Hernandez combined for in 2011 alone. Not that anyone expected Tate to produce similar numbers, but people perhaps expected more than they’ve seen so far. After all, he won the Biletnikoff Award at Notre Dame as the nations top college receiver and accumulated 25 receiving touchdowns in 2008 & 2009. The team lacked playmakers in 2010 and Seattle’s front office clearly believed Tate could change that.\n",
            "The point I’m getting at here is, these guys have proven production. In the case of Rice and Miller, it’s proven NFL production. Throw in the promise of Doug Baldwin and Anthony McCoy and this should be a group that you feel comfortable with. Sure, there isn’t the superstar high draft pick who legitimises a unit by reputation alone. Yet there should be enough talent to at least form the basis of a decent passing offense. This isn’t the Cleveland Browns where finding legitimate receivers is beyond a crucial need. It’s just in Seattle, these guys aren’t getting a chance to really show what they can do.\n",
            "I would argue it’s the same situation at quarterback. Robert Griffin III (+14), Ryan Tannehill (+27), Brandon Weeden (+40) and Andrew Luck (+47) all have more passing attempts than fellow rookie Russell Wilson. Pete Carroll has admitted he’s trying to limit turnovers at the moment and I believe him when he says it’d be the same situation for Matt Flynn. It’s not an individual issue at the quarterback position – it’s a scheme decision. It’s worth noting that Seattle has a better record than Griffin’s Redskins, Tannehill’s Dolphins, Weeden’s Browns and Luck’s Colts. Tannehill, Weeden and Luck have combined for 14 interceptions in three games. Griffin III and Wilson – the two quarterbacks with much less passing attempts – have combined for just two interceptions. Coincidence? Or smart coaching?\n",
            "The team wants to run the ball and limit turnovers – there’s no secret there. They are very happy right now to play field position, great defense and hope for one or two big plays to compliment the run game. If the defense can hold a powerhouse offense like Green Bay to twelve points and a decent Cowboys outfit to seven, it might not be the worst plan in the world at home. Yet when Wilson has been challenged he’s looked very sharp. For all the little errors we’ve seen (to be expected from a rookie) we’ve also seen three glorious looking touchdown passes to Rice (Arizona), McCoy (Dallas) and Tate (Green Bay – and not THAT touchdown pass).\n",
            "We look at the list of eligible 2013 receivers and wonder whether a guy like Justin Hunter, Cordarrelle Patterson or Keenan Allen could become a #1 target for Wilson – but what’s the point in making that investment if the team is throwing 15 passes at a guy earning $8.2m this year? We look at guys like Robert Woods and Tavon Austin and wonder if they could be the teams answer to Wes Welker or Percy Harvin, but are they going to have an impact if you’re not going to put the ball in their hands?\n",
            "Perhaps a time will come in the future when they feel confident to allow Wilson to let it rip? Maybe that day will come soon, but this is a regime that has consistently delivered bad numbers at the quarterback position. In 2010 Matt Hasselbeck was 21st for passing yards but delivered an ugly looking 12-17 touchdown-to-interception ratio. His QB rating was only higher than the bad version of Brett Favre, Derek Anderson and Jimmy Clausen. In 2011 Tarvaris Jackson had just 14 touchdowns – as many as Colt McCoy and twelve less than Mark Sanchez. He had a QB rating worse than Kevin Kolb. Ryan Fitzpatrick had over 700 more passing yards than Jackson and more touchdowns, but he also turned it over many more times. More than anything, they wanted Jackson to secure the football – something Hasselbeck struggled to do in 2010.\n",
            "Now Russell Wilson is near the bottom of the same lists. There are some positives because he’s not turning it over, but he’s also showing numbers that belittle all the pre-season hype that built up around the NFL – not just in Seattle. With good reason too – he was superb. It’s a bit like leaving a great car in the garage and then patting yourself on the back because it looks brand new. On the one hand, you have a perfectly unblemished motor vehicle. That’s cool. You’re not lying when you boast about it. But nobody ever sees you driving the thing, so people wonder ‘what’s the point’?\n",
            "The whole situation is being masked by a 2-1 record right now and rightly fans should be satisfied with that. Maybe the Seahawks go into St. Louis and Carolina and out fight their opponents before returning to Seattle with a fantastic 4-1 record? Who the heck is going to complain then if Russell Wilson throws barely over 100 yards in each game?\n",
            "Then there’s the other side of the coin. What if the Seahawks face a situation like the Arizona game? A closely fought contest on the road ending in defeat because when the game was on the line, they couldn’t throw the ball into the end zone? This could become more of an issue very quickly. In fact, had Seattle not been awarded a favorable decision on Monday, it would probably be the big talking point in the local media this week and not ‘that catch’.\n",
            "An unbalanced offense is easy to accept while the team is winning. If that continues, nobody will question anything. Go ‘Hawks! But a risk-free strategy still carries an element of risk. I think back to Rice in 2009, or Tate at Notre Dame, or Wilson in pre-season and wonder… can we turn this on like a tap when needed? Are we making the most of some talented skill players? And can we properly judge them in this current form of a Seahawks offense? Right now I’m not sure how we can judge this quarterback or group of receivers. They’re still in the original packaging.\n",
            "2013 could end up being ‘year of the defensive tackle’. Jonathan Jenkins (Georgia), Star Lotulelei (Utah), Sylvester Williams (North Carolina), Jonathan Hankins (Ohio State) and Kawann Short (Purdue) all look good enough to carry first round grades. Jesse Williams (Alabama) and Bennie Logan (LSU) could also get into the mix. And as the tape proves below, it’s time to put Missouri’s Sheldon Richardson on the list.\n",
            "He’s smaller than some of the guys listed above. Jenkins is a pure nose tackle with superb athleticism for his size, while Williams and Hankins are both capable of playing the nose or acting as a pass rusher. Short and Lotulelei are more orthodox three-techniques and Richardson – at 6-2 and 290lbs – falls into that category. He’s got a bit of the Nick Fairley’s about him in terms of size/athleticism and he’s just as capable as a pass rusher. Perhaps the best example of what an athlete he is are the number of snaps he takes in coverage. Not many defensive tackles drop back, even to monitor screens and underneath routes.\n",
            "There are some concerns – he’s a JUCO transfer with some reported baggage. He missed spring training this year through injury and teams will need to check out his shoulder as a consequence. He does have a quicker first step than any of the names above and perhaps his most impressive feature is his ability to finish. He’ll gain the advantage with initial burst, but he shifts up the gears to create pressure and execute. He’s very active and doesn’t give up on plays where he’s not directly involved. Richardson appears to do a decent job against the run although he’s more effective rushing the passer. Overall he has an impressive skill set for the three technique position.\n",
            "The Seahawks could still use further interior help particularly in the form of a legit pass rusher alongside Brandon Mebane. However, as we’ve seen in the three games so far the teams greatest needs are on offense. Even so this is an area to keep an eye on with so many potential first round picks next April.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "NFL fans should be embarrassed by what happened tonight. Sure, the Seahawks will take the win. Seattle is now 2-1 against the odds and with a bit of extra luck against a red-hot Arizona team they’d be unbeaten. The fact still remains – nobody can watch that replay and say the final play of the game tonight was anything but an interception. The league is a laughing stock this evening. That’s not taking anything away from the Seahawks who have endured a fair share of misfortune over the years, but they caught a break tonight.\n",
            "It wasn’t just the final play either. The Packers’ touchdown drive was extended by a farcical pass interference call against the Seahawks. Likewise, Seattle’s penultimate drive benefited from an equally stupid flag. An ugly, messy, difficult game got the ending it deserved.\n",
            "This is a Seahawks blog though and not an officiating blog, so let’s look at the team. The ending kind of masks a big issue facing the Seahawks. They clearly possess one of the league’s best defenses – it could even be #1 in the NFL. But they also possess one of the worst offenses and that has to be a big concern. It’s not about individuals either, it’s about a severe lack of balance.\n",
            "The Green Bay Packers failed to score a point in the first half as Seattle sacked Aaron Rodgers eight times and shut down both the pass and the run. It was a massacre, like a home game against the Rams over the last few years. Completely one sided. Most other weeks it’d be the precursor to a comfortable and maybe even emphatic victory. But the Seahawks offense wasn’t playing ball.\n",
            "Russell Wilson became the first QB in history to throw a game-winning interception.\n",
            "— Reign of Troy (@ReignofTroy)September 25, 2012\n",
            "\n",
            "At half time the Packers planned to slow down the pass rush by running the ball up the gut. Once they’d established the run, it afforded Rodgers more time and he got things moving. Throw in two no-huddle drives and momentum had shifted. The Seahawks needed to respond. It became a game where the Seahawks needed to keep up. They didn’t just fail, they failed in a big way.\n",
            "I’m still trying to work out the play calling. Even with a bigger lead than 7-0, you can’t expect to beat the Packers by being ultra conservative. We know the Seahawks want to run the ball and make that the identity of the team. That’s fine,but you still need balance. Russell Wilson barely threw double digit passes going into the final quarter. You can’t do that against the Green Bay Packers with a slender lead. You can’t do that against most teams. Not unless your running back is on the path to a 200-yard game which he wasn’t. The Seahawks are essentially playing without a passing game at the moment. At best it’s a token gesture.\n",
            "Do they not trust Russell Wilson as a rookie quarterback? Is it merely a misguided game plan? Whatever it is, they need to take a long look at what they’re doing on offense and try to establish a passing game of some form. Next time there won’t be a favorable refereeing decision to bail the team out. The game plan in the second half was almost as difficult to stomach as the replacement officials.\n",
            "We try to look at needs on this blog because the people who visit want to talk about the draft and the future of the team. Seattle’s greatest need right now is to review the offense. By all means keep the run game at the heart of what you want to do – Marshawn Lynch had another great game today. But you have to be prepared to mix it up a bit, get creative, trust Russell Wilson and the playmakers on the team. How can we criticise the quarterback when he isn’t throwing the ball? How can we criticise the receivers when they aren’t involved? Why bother paying Sidney Rice and Zach Miller $13m this year if you’re not going to use them? Or Golden Tate… or Anthony McCoy…\n",
            "And let’s not kid ourselves this isn’t a rare one off stumble. The offense stuttered mightily against Arizona and was poor in the first half against Dallas. The Cowboys were beaten into submission in the second half last week and they duly waved the white flag – but that won’t happen every week especially against the top teams. This is one of the most unbalanced offenses in the NFL, too heavily weighted towards the run. Time to take the training wheels off the passing game and use it.\n",
            "This game will always be remembered for the referee’s. The most important thing Seattle will get out of it other than a notch in the win column, is to have a serious look at the offense before next Sunday. They need to if they’re going to max out their potential this season.\n",
            "And Roger Goodell and the NFL owners need to sort their own mess out long before Sunday.\n",
            "Note: For what it’s worth,this is the first argument I’ve seen made for justifying why the referee’s called it how they did.\n",
            "Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron has enjoyed a strong start to 2012\n",
            "Time to give McCarron his props\n",
            "This is the time of year where several unbeaten college teams get vaulted into ‘national title’ contenders. Suddenly a few pundits wonder whether Notre Dame ‘are for real’ (they have no quarterback). Are Florida State good enough to mount a challenge? Every year these teams emerge, only to fall away. The question I always ask is – can these teams realistically take on Alabama? And the answer is usually no. In fact there’s probably only two teams I think are capable of that – SEC rival LSU and Oregon in the PAC-12. Even then Oregon might be a stretch given their inexperience at certain key positions, but they have enough speed and talent to make up for that.\n",
            "So why are Alabama so consistently great? After all, they’ve seen big-time NFL stars come and go. This is the first year in a long time they haven’t featured a pending first round player at the skill positions. They lost a host of top-end defensive talent to the draft last April. Yet every year they come back for more.\n",
            "The simple answer is they are the best coached team in college football. Nick Saban – love him or hate him – is the best in the business. They are organised, disciplined, committed and playing for each other. Saban constantly churns out elite defensive backs and a brilliant running game. He recruits in such a way that players are desperate to come and play for him. Winning helps, too.\n",
            "This year they have a fine offensive line filled with experienced talent such as Barrett Jones and Chance Warmack. They have enough defensive line quality to create pressure and dominate up front. There’s also one other reason they’re doing so well and it’s about time this guy got some credit.\n",
            "Quarterback A.J. McCarron isn’t going to be a top draft choice. Saban has found production from a string of solid, hard working quarterbacks who act as game managers and facilitate the run. John Parker Wilson and Greg McElroy weren’t very exciting to watch and lacked the physical tools to become a NFL starter, but it’s no surprise both have stuck in the league as backups. McCarron is a little bit different, a little better physically and a lot more dynamic. He’s still cut from the same cloth – he’s more facilitator than playmaker, but for me he has much more of a chance at playing time at the next level. Even if that isn’t the case – it’s about time he received some credit. He won a national title in his first year as a starter and so far in 2012 he has ten touchdowns and zero interceptions, 63% completions and a couple of blowout wins against Michigan and Arkansas.\n",
            "He’s a junior and eligible for the 2013 draft, but he’s more likely to last the distance at Alabama and potentially record three national title’s. His supporting cast is good enough to do that. I’m not sure why he isn’t getting the credit he deserves – is it the personality, which is certainly more expressive than McElroy or Wilson? He’s still a ‘by the book’ type of guy and certainly on an intangible level teams will grade him highly. On a technical level he has average arm strength, but he goes through his progressions and makes very few mistakes. He’s economical, takes what he’s given and on a good team that can run the ball he’s going to offer some value. I’m not here to argue he’s a future first round pick but it’s time he got a bit more credit. He’s the glue holding Alabama’s excellent offense together and a key reason why the Crimson Tide make teams like Florida State bit-part players for the big game. Keep an eye on this guy.\n",
            "Week four stock up\n",
            "Tavon Autin (WR, West Virginia)\n",
            "Explosive playmaker who recorded 13 catches, three touchdowns and 179 yards against Maryland on Saturday. If missing on Russell Wilson has taught me anything, it’s not to presume anything when a guy doesn’t have prototypical size. Austin is only 5-9 and 174lbs and that limits his stock – he’s not going to win many jump balls, he’ll face a lot more physicality at the next level and he won’t be able to out-run people in the same way. Even so, he’s a big-time playmaker. There’s no reason why teams won’t see a little DeSean Jackson in this guy and a team that needs a spark on offense might consider taking a shot. After all – Wes Welker is only 5-9 and 185lbs. Austin theoretically has more of an X-Factor and can be used in many different ways at the next level. At worst he’s a round two pick.\n",
            "Corey Lemonier (DE, Auburn)\n",
            "Lemonier has been nothing short of sensational so far this year. Like Austin, he’s not exactly a prototype at 6-4 and 246lbs. However, he has extreme speed off the edge and a knack of just making plays. He’s edgy and intense and the heart of the Tigers defense. He saved his best game so far for LSU and ended up with two sacks and numerous other splash plays. He has five total sacks for the year and appears set to give Jarvis Jones a run for his money as the SEC’s top pass rusher. Lemonier isn’t going to fit every scheme and 3-4 teams will have to weigh up whether he fits at OLB. He looks like a good fit at the LEO if the Seahawks wanted to make back-to-back first round picks at defensive end. The best thing is you feel he can get even better.\n",
            "Justin Hunter (WR, Tennessee)\n",
            "He was on the sliders list last week, but this weekend could end up being a defining moment for Hunter.Cordarrelle Patterson was partly responsible for a pick-six in the first quarter against Akron, and Tyler Bray seemed to avoid him for the rest of the half. Step forward Justin Hunter, who at times has played second fiddle to Patterson in the Vols passing game in 2012. He looked sharp in an eight-catch 115 yard performancethat included a touchdown. If Bray is going to zone in on Hunter the rest of the way – and if both players can stay healthy – this can only be good for the receivers’ stock. He has the potential to be the top wide-out taken next April.\n",
            "Week four stock down\n",
            "Montee Ball (RB, Wisconsin)\n",
            "It was a big surprise to see Ball return to Wisconsin this year, undoubtedly with the view of making up for last year’s gut-wrenching Rose Bowl defeat. The thing is – he’s a running back with tread on the tires. The chances of the Badgers surviving the departure of Russell Wilson were slim and they’re in the middle of a down-year. Ball had 33 rushing touchdowns last year but in 2012 has just three in four games. He averaged 6.2 yards per carry in 2010 and 2011, but has started this season averaging 3.9 yards per carry. As of today he has 661 college carries, which is already over 100 more than Trent Richardson had at Alabama. And to make matters worse, he picked up a head injury on Saturday and lost his first career fumble. I like Ball, but returning for a fourth year at Wisconsin is hurting his stock.\n",
            "Matt Barkley (QB, USC)\n",
            "Barkley ended the 2011 season with real momentum and the critics should go back and watch his performance vs Oregon before jumping on the negativity bandwagon. However, he hasn’t started this season particularly well. Against Syracuse he looked off the pace despite scoring six touchdowns and things got worse against Stanford and California. He has five interceptions already compared to seven for the entire season last year. Losing Matt Kalil to the draft and Khaled Holmes to injury hasn’t helped, but Barkley needs to prove he can excel without an ideal environment. If he’s drafted early next April, he cannot expect to immediately play in a fluid offense with a great offensive line. And while he’s undoubtedly talented, I just wonder if he’s destined to be a top-20 pick instead of the #1 pick.\n",
            "Barkevious Mingo (DE, LSU)\n",
            "At a generously listed 6-5 and 240lbs, Mingo relies on speed off the edge. He came into the year touted as a possible top-ten pick despite his size, but so far in 2012 he has zero sacks. That’s not the be-all and end-all, but he’s not really had much impact either. Consider that LSU has so far come up against the ‘might’ of North Texas, an over-matched Washington and struggling Auburn. Teams are zoning in on Mingo and he’s being taken out of games. This is helping Sam Montgomery, who is looking a lot sharper with less attention after a slow start to the year himself. If Mingo is going to live up to expectations he needs to start having more of an impact. Time is on his side.\n",
            "Tyler Wilson game tape vs Rutgers\n",
            "Arkansas’ struggles continued at the weekend and Wilson’s ‘quitters’ speech from last week failed to spark a response. He ended the day with three touchdowns, but also two interceptions. He didn’t get much help in this one from his receivers. Keep an eye on Cobi Hamilton, who had over 300 yards receiving and could be a second or third round pick.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Credit where it’s due to E.J. Manuel. He put in probably the best performance of his career to inspire Florida State to a big win over Clemson and the Seminoles are now in pole position to win the ACC. However, I still have no confidence in Manuel as a pro prospect. He has all the physical tools you want and certainly he looks the part. In this game he abused a sluggish Clemson defense with some clinical passes – but against a tougher defense the athleticism and arm strength won’t be enough. In the NFL he’s going to need to make quick decisions at the line, he’s going to need to diagnose confusing coverage situations and he’s going to need to progress through reads. He does none of this at the moment and when challenged, often makes poor decisions. He faced no pressure against Clemson and it afforded him the chance to make plays. There will be tougher tests to come for Manuel and he’ll show why, unfortunately, he’s always going to be more of an athlete than a quarterback.\n",
            "For Clemson, DeAndre Hopkins had a fast start – catching a 60 yard bomb from Tajh Boyd on the opening possession. He got deep, did well to locate the football and win it competing against the defensive back. Hopkins ended with five catches for 88 yards. Andre Ellington will have a role in the NFL too – he only had 55 yards from 14 carries but he added a spectacular touchdown reception from a double pass – breaking off a 52-yard run. He had 4 total catches for 87 yards. Bjoern Werner didn’t have much of an impact as a pass rusher for Florida State but he did make one key open field tackle and he also recorded a pass deflection. This is the first time in 2012 Werner hasn’t recorded a sack. Clemson’s up-tempo quick-hitting offense didn’t really allow much of a pass rush.\n",
            "We published tape of Manti Te’o vs Michigan State yesterday, but the Notre Dame linebacker was even better against Michigan yesterday. He had two interceptions and a forced fumble in a 13-6 victory. Luke Kuechly was the 9thoverall pick this year because of athleticism, intangibles and the way he churned out 100’s of tackles in his college career. Kuechly was never a big playmaker though, rarely impacting games for his team. Te’o isn’t the same kind of athlete, but he has more of an X-factor. For me he’s the superior player.\n",
            "Georgia’s Jarvis Jones didn’t play against Florida Atlantic last week, but he returned in a 48-3 victory over Vanderbilt and recorded yet another sack. In three games he has 4.5 in total and could easily be the first player drafted next April depending on need. Quarterback Aaron Murray continued his possible Heisman charge with 18/24 passing for 250 yards. He had three total touchdowns and zero turnovers. Murray is only around 6-0/6-1 in height and he can be very streaky, but he’s started well this year. If quarterbacks like Tyler Wilson, Tyler Bray and Landry Jones continue to struggle, he could easily develop into a first or second round pick.\n",
            "Whatever Logan Thomas is doing right now, it isn’t working. Virginia Tech rebounded after a bad loss to Pittsburgh last week, beating Bowling Green 37-0. However, Thomas completed just 11/26 passing for 144 yards. He had an interception too – but on a positive note had three total touchdowns and 65 rushing yards. Even so, this appears to be another mixed performance. It’ll be an upset if he declares for 2013 in this form.\n",
            "It was a better day for Geno Smith at West Virginia. This was the Mountaineers toughest game so far and they squeezed through 31-21 against Maryland. Smith ended with 30/43 passing for 338 yards and three touchdowns. However the big star of the day was Tavon Austin – 13 catches, 179 yards and three touchdowns. Austin is a potential first round pick as an explosive playmaker. We’ll take a closer look at him over the next few days but he has a little DeSean Jackson and Percy Harvin to his game. You can see Smith’s tape from the game at the top of this article. Obviously this also includes Austin’s 13 catches. Take a look, because as discussed we’ll come back to this guy later in the week.\n",
            "The honeymoon period is over for Jim Mora – and to some extent for talented running back Jonathan Franklin. After exploding into the new season, he managed just 45 yards from 12 carries against Oregon State as UCLA lost 27-20. Tight end Joseph Fauria had two catches for 20 yards. I’ll watch the tape of this one later in the week.\n",
            "Marcus Lattimore had his most productive day since returning from injury. The South Carolina running back had 85 yards from 21 carries with two touchdowns against Missouri – but he also added 60 yards from seven receptions. If he can keep building momentum on an unbeaten team, his stock will rise. The Gamecocks won comfortably 31-10.\n",
            "Somehow, Washington State lost 35-34 to Colorado. Marquess Wilson had another big night, registering five catches for 99 yards and two touchdowns. It’ll be no consolation for Mike Leach. Colorado were 17 down with 7:22 to play and winless until this week.\n",
            "Underrated UNC defensive tackle Sylvester Williams had another sack as the Tar Heels defeated East Carolina 27-6. Williams has 3.5 sacks in four games. He’s a strong interior presence against the run but he can penetrate and rush the passer. He’s scheme diverse and should be an early pick next April.\n",
            "Tennessee receiver Cordarrelle Patterson maybe came down to earth a bit this weekend. He had only two receptions for 20 yards and two rushes for 12 yards in a 47-26 win over Akron. He was also partly responsible for a pick six early in the game – losing position and not being physical enough to shield the ball. That could be the reason he failed to record any stats in the first half, with Bray zoning in on other targets. Patterson is still raw and needs to rebound in the next game. It was a better day for Justin Hunter with eight catches for 115 yards and a touchdown. Tyler Bray finished with 27/43 passing, 401 yards and four touchdowns. It’ll be interesting to see if Bray favours Hunter over Patterson going forward. The reverse was true in previous weeks.\n",
            "Arkansas is a mess. A complete shambles. Poorly coached, the Bobby Petrino scandal has hit them harder than anyone could expect. They were beaten again yesterday 35-26 by a superior Rutgers team. Tyler Wilson’s stock is sinking. He completed 20/39 passing for 419 yards and three scores, but he also had two interceptions. But perhaps most damaging is the way his team failed to respond to the ‘quitters’ speech last week. If you’re going to call out your teammates, it has to have an impact. On a more positive note, Cobi Hamilton had 10 catches for an incredible 303 receiving yards and three touchdowns. It was another long day for Knile Davis however, who had just 17 yards from ten carries.\n",
            "Matt Barkley is going through a poorly timed slump. Against California he was OK, but had another two interceptions to go along with two scores, 192 yards and 22/34 passing. USC’s usually functioning offense is a bit off-cue at the moment, largely due to issues on the offensive line. Here’s the thing though – Barkley has to be able to adapt to that. Teams picking early next year will need to feel confident that he can operate in not-ideal circumstances. He’s too technically talented to drop too far, but it’s this kind of scenario that makes him a top-10 pick rather than the top-1 pick. He doesn’t have the physical tools to carry a team that isn’t performing. And this is what we’ve always said about Barkley’s stock – some teams will love his poise, accuracy and field intelligence. Others will wonder whether he’s physically gifted enough to warrant a very high pick. Robert Woods only had 5 catches for the day for 30 yards.\n",
            "Landry Jones is still playing like Landry Jones. Oklahoma lost at home to Kansas State yesterday 24-19, with Jones going 28/43 for 298 yards, one touchdown and one interception. However, we’re seeing the same old issues with pressure, the same inability to react when the play breaks down, zero inspiration and awareness. At one point Jones rolled out of the pocket and locked onto a receiver downfield, took an age and was sacked – forcing a fumble which was returned for a short touchdown. Its plays like that he should be avoiding at this stage in his career. He started last season as a mid-round talent and 12 months on, things aren’t getting any better.\n",
            "I’m going to watch the LSU/Auburn tape later this week, but I did notice that through four weeks Barkevious Mingo is sackless. That has to be some concern for a speed pass-rush specialist whose only opposition so far has been North Texas (blowout), Washington (blowout), Idaho (blowout) and Auburn (close victory). Sam Montgomery, in comparison, has two sacks. Corey Lemonier on the other hand is going from strength to strength. I did watch a bit of the Auburn game last night and he was flying around making plays. He had two sacks on the night – now five for the season against tough opponents like LSU, Clemson and Mississippi State. His stock is flying up the boards. He might be the best pure pass rusher eligible for 2013 after Jarvis Jones. He’s not a big defensive end and will either transition to a 3-4 OLB or need to play in a system that favours speed vs prototypical size (eg Seattle). Yet Lemonier is one of the fastest risers in college football and is creating a big impression.\n",

            "The celebration calls for its usual festivities — fireworks, champagne, resolutions and one of the most famous traditions of all: watching the ball drop. Whether in person or in the comforts of your own home, the New Year’s Eve countdown is renowned across the world.\n",

            "To celebrate the iconic “ball drop” wouldn’t it be fun to look back at some of the most memorable dropped balls? We think so. So, without further ado…\n",
            "BetFTW presents: The five most unforgettable dropped passes in recent NFL memory.\n",
            "It’s hard to place all the blame on Wes Welker for his costly drop in Super Bowl XLVI, but it’s not unjustified.\n",
            "Tom Brady’s Patriots were driving late into the fourth quarter with a two-point lead over the Giants and time on their side. A first down or two could have bled the clock and forced New York into a tough spot with the time dwindling and just one remaining timeout. Brady dropped back on 2nd & 11 and aired one to an open Welker across the left side of the field, only for the ball to bounce off of his hands and fall incomplete.\n",
            "Now, could the throw have been better? Absolutely. Welker got two hands on it, though, and could have hauled in the football. The pass fell incomplete and so did the next, causing the clock to stop multiple times.\n",
            "The Giants got the ball back and, marched down the field to a go-ahead Ahmad Bradshaw touchdown run with under a minute to play.\n",
            "Nick Foles had the Eagles’ faithfulthisclose to actually believing a consecutive Super Bowl appearance was on the horizon. Not that the divisional round win assures anything, but the vibes were there.\n",
            "Anyways, Alshon Jeffery put a stop to that.\n",
            "After a missed Saints field goal, Foles and the Philly offense quickly moved into New Orleans territory. Down 20-14, they were looking for six with around two minutes to play. Foles delivered a crosser over the middle to Jeffery, which slipped through his hands and into New Orleans’ defensive back Marshon Lattimore’s.\n",

            "The interception all but ended the game. The Saints ran the clock out after an Alvin Kamara first-down pickup, and New Orleans moved on to the next round.\n",
            "My apologies to all of the Patriots fans out there for bringing up a second Super Bowl drop, but this one is just too good to pass up.\n",
            "Danny Amendola took a reverse and flung a pass out of the backfield to streaking Tom Brady running free in the flats. Brady, looking as uncomfortable as ever, short-armed the football in preparation for a big hit from the ghost of a defensive back that was nearing him.\n",
            "While it was a third-down play early in the second quarter, the drop probably didn’t have a big impact on the outcome of Philadelphia’s 41-33 win over New England.\n",
            "The drop was even more noteworthy thanks to Nick Foles catching the game-winning touchdown pass just a couple of quarters later.\n",
            "A lot was made of Odell Beckham Jr. and his Giants teammates heading to Miami for a boat trip prior to their NFC Wild Card matchup with the Green Bay Packers. I’m not sure if the outing had any impact on their poor performance just days later, but the whole situation didn’t look good.\n",
            "Beckham finished with four catches for 28 yards on 11 targets, including three drops, as the Giants were routed 38-13 by Aaron Rodgers and the Packers at Lambeau.\n",
            "This list of drops wouldn’t be complete without undoubtedly the most controversial of them all. Dez Bryant’s “drop” against the Packers in 2014 changed the trajectory of his career and ended Dallas’ special season.\n",
            "Trailing 26-21 well into the fourth quarter, the Cowboys went 50 yards down the field before they faced a 4th & 2 from the Green Bay 32-yard line. Romo floated a beautiful pass down the left sideline that was grabbed spectacularly out of the air at the 1-yard line by Dez Bryant. Dallas was then a yard away from tying the game with a chance to take the lead.\n",
            "However, the catch was challenged. Despite Bryant clearly controlling the ball after coming down in bounds, a stretch for the goal line jarred the ball loose on contact with the ground — enough for the officials to overturn the catch. As a result, turnover on downs.\n",
            "Dallas never got the ball back as the Packers were able to hold the ball and the lead for the remaining four minutes and change.\n",

            "Watch CBS News\n",
            "November 11, 2012 / 5:31 PM EST/ CBS Boston\n",
            "BOSTON (CBS) -- Prepare for at least one full week of Patriots panic in New England.\n",
            "In this case, it just may be warranted, as the New England defense played extremely poorly for much of the afternoon on Sunday at Gillette Stadium. However, thanks to a couple of huge forced turnovers around the goal line, the defense played well enough --barely-- to walk away with a 37-31 victory.\n",
            "In the win, there were plenty of positives and negatives, so let's get into the Four Ups and Four Downs from the New England win.\n",
            "Four Ups\n",
            "Tom Brady\n",
            "While the awful defensive showing will dominate most of the discussion this week, don't forget Tom Brady's play. It wasn't the greatest performance of his career, but he led an offense that came close to putting together a perfect showing for essentially three full quarters of football. Excluding a two-play drive before halftime, the Patriots' first seven drives ended like this: field goal, touchdown, touchdown, touchdown, punt, touchdown, field goal. And as it turned out, the Patriots ended up needing every single one of their 37 points.\n",
            "Brady himself went 23-for-38 for 237 yards and a pair of touchdowns, but most importantly he threw zero interceptions. In this game, with the New England defense playing so poorly, any turnover would have been absolutely crushing. Brady limited his mistakes, knew when to throw the ball away, and took just one sack despite facing a decent amount of pressure for much of the game.\n",
            "It was the type of Brady performance that tends to get taken for granted at times in New England. I'd argue that this week, it shouldn't.\n",
            "Stephen Gostkowski\n",
            "Another performance that should not get overlooked is that of Stephen Gostkowski. Often, if a kicker isn't out there making a last-second field goal, his afternoon can get overlooked, but had Gostkowski not had the day he had, this very well could have been a loss for New England.\n",
            "He was a perfect 3-for-3 on field goal attempts, including a 43-yarder to give the Pats a 3-0 lead and later a 48-yarder to give the Patriots a two-possession lead in the fourth quarter. Had he missed that 48-yarder, the Bills would have taken over near midfield trailing by just a touchdown. Considering the Bills drove 93 yards on the drive that followed that kick, it's very likely the game would have been tied at some point in the fourth quarter. Thanks to Gostkowski, that never happened.\n",
            "And while his third kick may have been just a chip shot, it nevertheless gave the Patriots a much-needed cushion, thereby forcing the Bills to play for a touchdown rather than a field goal.\n",
            "Danny Woodhead\n",
            "\"Little\" Danny Woodhead, as he's unofficially known to seemingly every announcer in the world, had just two touchdowns on the season, but he found the end zone twice on Sunday for the first time in his career.\n",
            "His only carry was a big one, as he exploded through a hole for a 15-yard touchdown run.\n",
            "Averaging 2.4 receptions for 25 yards per game this season, Woodhead stepped up in Aaron Hernandez's absence with four catches for 46 yards and a touchdown. The scoring play was a beautiful one, as he burned his man (linebacker Nick Barnett) and juked Jarius Byrd near the 3-yard line before diving across the goal line for the score.\n",
            "It was the type of extra effort that defines Woodhead as an NFL player, and it was a major reason why the Patriots came out on top in this one.\n",
            "Stevan Ridley\n",
            "It wasn'tquitethe 106-yard, two-touchdown performance that Ridley had earlier in the year against Buffalo, but it was close. The second-year running back looked awfully refreshed coming off the bye week, as he finished with 98 rushing yards and a score for the home team.\n",
            "He played a major role in the Patriots sustaining long scoring drives, which was crucial considering the Bills' offense could drive the ball at will.\n",
            "Four Downs\n",
            "\"Everything\"\n",
            "It's a common saying from Bill Belichick: We have to play better and we have to coach better. Nothing better sums up this game than that saying right there.\n",
            "Matt Patricia watched all afternoon as rookie Alfonzo Dennard chased Stevie Johnson in vain, to the effect of Johnson catching six passes for 86 yards. Yet no noticeable changes were made to the defensive assignments. For that matter, the entire middle of the field was wide open for Ryan Fitzpatrick all day long, and he probably hasn't thrown two easier touchdown passes since he was facing Brown University back in '03.\n",
            "You can pick on individual performances all you want, and that's fair, but the Patriots' defensive woes can't be attributed to any one person, be it a player or a coach. There's a lot of work to be done if this team wants to really compete for a championship. Getting 148 penalty yards and three somewhat gift-wrapped turnovers and still only beating the Bills by six points just isn't going to cut it.\n",
            "Mental Mistakes\n",
            "The Patriots' defense didn't need to give the Buffalo offense any extra yards, yet three mental mistakes proved costly.\n",
            "Dennard took a dive at Fitzpatrick's legs after the quarterback scrambled out of bounds, giving the Bills a free 15 yards and getting them to the edge of the red zone. Three plays later, Fitzpatrick connected with Scott Chandler for a touchdown to cut the Patriots' lead in half just before halftime.\n",
            "Brandon Spikes made the next mental mistake, going helmet-to-facemask on Fitzpatrick on a second-down incompletion early in the fourth quarter. Instead of a third-and-8 from their own 47, the Bills had a first-and-10 from the New England 38. While the Patriots did force a turnover at the goal line, the offense couldn't do anything with that field position and punted the ball right back to the Bills, who scored a touchdown on the ensuing drive.\n",
            "But on the first play of that ensuing drive, it was Jerod Mayo with the unnecessary late hit out of bounds on C.J. Spiller. The penalty took the Bills from the Pats' 31-yard line to the 16-yard line, and sure enough the Bills were in the end zone three plays later.\n",
            "The defense is simply not talented enough to be making these types of errors, and it nearly cost them a win on Sunday.\n",
            "And while Buffalo had an absurdly high number of penalties, the Patriots' seven penalties for 73 yards were far too many. Ridley's false start on second-and-goal from the 4-yard line was chief among them, as it may have turned a touchdown drive into a field goal drive.\n",
            "Drops\n",
            "Seven points turned into three points on the Patriots' opening drive due to Wes Welker's dropping a surefire touchdown. On the same drive, Deion Branch dropped a would-be first down when he let a pass from Brady bounce off his stomach. That ball very well should have been picked off, but Branch was alert enough to rip the ball out of the defensive back's hands.\n",
            "Julian Edelman later let a long bomb from Brady sail through his arms, though he was bailed out by a penalty on Buffalo away from the play. Later, with the Patriots trying to drive from their own 1-yard line, Welker had another big drip over the middle on what should have moved the chains. Instead, the Patriots were forced to punt two plays later, and the Bills scored on the ensuing drive to cut the lead to just a field goal in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "If Welker can squeeze those passes, this game very well could have looked a lot different than it did. Of course, Welker's six catches for 74 yards shouldn't be dismissed, but his drops provide an example of the Patriots' inner drive to always improve and always believe they can be better.\n",
            "Third-down defense\n",
            "For all the Patriots' defensive faults, one or two more stops on third (or fourth) down would have made a big impact. The Bills were able to convert seven of their 11 third-down attempts, and they also went 1-for-1 on fourth-down conversions. This inability for the defense to get off the field was the biggest culprit for the Patriots' being unable to build an insurmountable lead and ultimately losing the time of possession battle by nearly eight minutes.\n",
            "As was mentioned with the blaming of \"Everything\" earlier, this issue can't be pinned on any one person, but it's going to be rather difficult to beat good teams and will be darn near impossible to win playoff games if this defense can't make more plays, force punts, and keep the ball in Brady's hands.\n",

            "Chase Stuart took an aggressive, offensive approach to the Rookie Scouting Portfolio Writers Project, spending $93.5 million of his $150 million salary cap on his offense. Can’t say I blame him.He has a nice mix of young skill talent and veteran gritand his dollar cost averaging for his offensive line could pay off.\n",
            "Although his defense has some clear weaknesses, he also has talented players that should do a good job of playing aggressive football when Stuart’s team has a lead. If this team gets behind early it could be problematic, but I can see how this offense is set up for this team to go 10-6, even in a tough division.\n",
            "Learn more about Stuart’s team below as the writer atFootballguys.com,Pro Football Reference, and (his new blog)Football Perspectiveprovides an engaging take on the RSP Writers Project.\n",
            "Describe your offensive system.\n",
            "The offense will be a hybrid of what the Manning Colts did combined with some elements from the offenses in New England, Green Bay and New Orleans.  The base set would be three wide receivers with a tight end – Graham and Cruz on the inside, Boldin and Smith on the outside – and Hunter in the backfield.\n",
            "Delanie Walker will get his fair share of playing time, as Manning likes the two-tight end sets and we won’t keep Graham in to block all that often.   With Walker helping to give Manning extra time, Manning will be able to isolate Cruz, Graham or Smith on any given play.  In running situations, we can bring in Vladimir Ducasse as a sixth lineman or Matt Mulligan.\n",
            "Blocking Schemes, Bread and Butter Plays, and Pivotal Players in the Scheme:\n",
            "The offense runs through Peyton Manning and he is the offense.  Everyone else is replaceable, but Manning will be the quarterback and de facto offensive coordinator.  For the long-term, whichever quarterback that replaces Manning will be pretty lucky to have Jimmy Graham and Victor Cruz to throw to.  They’re two of the most difficult players to cover in the NFL.\n",
            "Coordinators and Coaches:\n",
            "The goal is to recreate the elite passing offenses that we’ve seen in Indianapolis, New England, Green Bay and New Orleans.  In Indianapolis and New England, I’m not so sure there is a coach we can identify as the man behind the success as much as the quarterback.  But I’d love to have Mike McCarthy or Sean Payton or Tom Clements on my coaching staff, and obviously I’d take Belichick no matter what team I had.  Mike Leach would be another great fit, but honestly, having Peyton Manning and Tom Moore is probably all I would need.\n",
            "Describe your defensive system.\n",
            "I envision the 4-3 defense playing a blend of the Tampa-2 that Dungy brought to Indianapolis along with the more exotic Baltimore/Ryan scheme.  The Tampa-2 worked well with the Colts thanks to Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis, and the hope is that Shea McClellin, Aaron Maybin and Vinny Curry can provide a similar level of pass rush.  But the Colts never had the talent in the secondary that this defense has – Eric Berry, Morris Claiborne, Ike Taylor, Ryan Clark and Kyle Wilson – which will enable us to play more man coverage.   In the event that we don’t have an elite pass rusher, we will need to have more creative blitzes, and in that case, we’ll be fortunate to have more talented defenders in the secondary.  I consider Wilson a starter as a nickel corner, as the defense will probably play nickel more than anything else.\n",
            "Claiborne and Berry are the anchors of the secondary, although the unit couldn’t excel if any of the five members of the secondary didn’t possess strong pass coverage skills.  Phil Taylor is the key to the front seven; when healthy, he’ll make the job easier for every other defensive linemen, who will keep our linebackers free to make plays.\n",
            "Defensive Coordinators and Coaches:\n",
            "Rex Ryan or Rob Ryan would both be good fits.  I’d love to bring back Tony Dungy just because I think he’s an excellent defensive mind.  Ditto Mike Tomlin.\n",
            "Where do you believe your offense is vulnerable in terms of system and personnel and what specifically have you done to minimize the impact of those vulnerabilities?\n",
            "Obviously the offensive line is less than stellar.  However, what I have done is avoided having any obvious holes on the line.  While none of the starters cost more than $5 million per year, none of them cost less than $4.5 million per year, either.  I believe a balanced offensive line is more important than the individual parts.\n",
            "Offensive linemen are nominally offensive players, of course, but on pass plays, they play defensive roles.  They retreat, and they block, preventing the aggressors from reaching the quarterback.  They’re gatekeepers, and the key to an effective gate is more about the strength of the weakest link than the strongest one.  Defenses will attack my offensive line, but I don’t believe there’s any obvious weakness for opposing defensive coordinators to focus on.  If you have $25 million to spend on your offensive line, the smartest move in my opinion is to evenly distribute that money, and that’s exactly what I did.\n",
            "Where do you believe your defense is vulnerable in terms of system and personnel and what specifically have you done to minimize the impact of those vulnerabilities?\n",
            "The linebackers are the weak spot of the defense, but I anticipate having five or six defensive backs on the field frequently.  The run defense could also be a weak spot, but the thinking is Taylor by himself can really help shut down the running game.  Against run heavy teams, Cody will be playing a significant role, and the hope is that Heyward or “MTV” can develop, too.\n",
            "Who are your stars and why did you invest so much in them?\n",
            "Peyton Manning is the key.  With an elite quarterback and competent weapons, you can just about pencil your team in for the playoffs.  With Jimmy Graham and Victor Cruz, I’ve got one player who ranked in the top three in receptions and one in the top three in receiving yards in 2011.  Those three can form the cornerstone of the offense for the next three-to-five years.\n",
            "On defense, Taylor is there as the man who can support all the run-stopping responsibilities on his massive shoulders.  Eric Berry and Maurice Claiborne are young and dynamic members of the secondary and would help anchor my pass defense.  With an excellent offense, being able to protect the lead and shut down opposing passing attacks is paramount.\n",
            "Name some of your offensive role players who might be role players now, but you believe could develop into much more as a starter or even star in your organization.\n",
            "Between Nate Davis and Colt McCoy, the hope is one of them can replace Manning in a few years.  LaMichael James could be a starter as quickly as 2012.  T.Y. Hilton may take a couple of years to develop, but he could easily become a starter as Boldin is phased out of the offense.\n",
            "Name some of your defensive role players who might be role players now, but you believe could develop into much more as a starter or even star in your organization.\n",
            "On the defensive line, Cameron Heyward has the potential to be an every down starter in this league.  I also think Cody has significant upside as a run-stuffing tackle.  It’s hard to get a read on Aaron Maybin, but he could certainly blossom in an excellent pass rusher, which will make him extremely valuable even if he never starts a game.  In the secondary, I am excited about the prospect of Kyle Wilson as a nickel corner, but he will be a starter within a couple of seasons.\n",
            "Which of your starters or significant situational contributors on your rosters do you believe would be on the roster bubble in 2013?\n",
            "For age reasons, Anquan Boldin and Ike Taylor may not last long.  At the linebacker position, I’ve invested so little in them that any of the starters could lose their job due to poor performance, and would anticipate hitting that position early in the 2013 draft.\n",
            "What was the most difficult part of the selection process for you?\n",
            "I attacked the offense first and then the secondary, leaving little money left for my front seven.  I really wanted to grab Phil Taylor, but it left me extremely low on resources for the rest of my starters.  As a result, finding three linebackers and the other defensive tackle was a struggle.\n",
            "I also couldn’t decide exactly what wide receivers would excel in my Manning-style offense.  Cruz did much of his damage in the slot last year, and I was a little concerned that he would excel as a number one wide receiver on my team.  But the thought of replacing him with a similarly-priced but less explosive player didn’t appeal to me.\n",
            "Based on your roster what type of playing facility would you want as your home stadium (describe the facility as outdoors, indoors, turf, grass, climate)?\n",
            "Like the Saints and Colts, I’d like to play indoors and on turf.  Obviously the Patriots and Packers have managed to create high-flying pass offenses outdoors, but I don’t think that is ideal for my passing offense.  Considering the speed of my defense – including McClellin, Maybin, Claiborne and Berry – I think a dome suits them best, too. And remember, the Packers have won only one home playoff game since 2003.  The Patriots won two home playoff games last year, but weather wasn’t a factor in either game, and New England hadn’t won a home playoff game since ’07 prior to last year.\n",
            "Name three risky personnel selections on offense and explain why (talent, off-field, age, injury, fit, etc.).\n",
            "I’m not sure if Kendall Hunter is a starting every down running back, which is why I invested heavily in backups Pierre Thomas and LaMichael James.\n",
            "Obviously Jonathan Martin is a low-end left tackle, and one could argue that protecting your star quarterback who missed all of last season should have been a priority for this team.\n",
            "I spent $93.5 million on my offense, presumably quite a bit more than the average person.  For that reason, I shouldn’t have too many risky starters, and I don’t think I do.  If forced to make a third pick, I suppose Manning is the choice. Due to age and injury history, it’s risky taking him over spending an extra four million on Brady.\n",
            "Name three risky personnel selections on defense and explain why (see above).\n",
            "By spending only $55.5 million on defense, I should have more risky personnel selections on defense, and you could quibble with any of my front seven picks.  I spent $7 million on Taylor, who is coming off of an injury.  My other three starters on the defensive line are all rookies, which may not jive with an offense that’s been built to win now. McClellin, Crick and Curry look like good picks, but they’re obviously unproven.\n",
            "All three linebackers come with questions.  Hawk has been inconsistent his whole career, and was part of a terrible defense last year.  Hill and McClain played well last year, but are not elite players and do not have long histories of success.\n",
            "Name a few players you really wished to add, but couldn’t find the room due to the restrictions of the salary cap or the fit within your team’s system.\n",
            "I would have liked to have gone with Brady, Brees or Rodgers, but decided to roll the dice with Manning due to salary concerns.  Tyron Smith would have been a great player to add, but I just couldn’t justify so much money at one position on the offensive line.  I started this with the idea of having Darren Sproles, but $6.5 million for a committee running back just wouldn’t work.  On defense, building around Haloti Ngata would have been great, but I was forced to settle for Phil Taylor.  I would have liked to have had at least one elite coverage outside linebacker, but there just wasn’t enough money in the budget for that.\n",
            "Which players on your team would you have added even if they cost more than the listed price?\n",
            "An elite quarterback was necessary for the offense I wanted to run.  I took Manning because he was cheaper than the others, but there was no way I wasn’t going to grab an All-Pro type.   Otherwise I mostly looked for value.  I thought Jimmy Graham and Victor Cruz were good values, but I wanted to make sure I gave my quarterback some elite options.  But in the NFL, almost everyone is replaceable, so I really wouldn’t reach for anyone.\n",
            "How do you think the makeup of your roster and distribution of your resources illustrates where your philosophy breaks with NFL conventional wisdom?\n",
            "NFL conventional wisdom is a funny thing, as I’m not sure if it even exists.  But I suppose if I told people that “offensive lines and defenses are overrated, it’s all about the skill position players” that I would be mocked as a fantasy geek.\n",
            "The truth is, individual players on offensive lines and on defense can be overrated.  As a Jets fan, I watched Darrelle Revis have a magnificent season in 2009, shutting down every wide receiver and help the other ten members on defense.  He was the reason the Jets ranked #1 in nearly every major defensive category that season.  Then, in the AFC Championship Game, Manning torched the rest of the Jets defense, as Pierre Garcon and Austin Collie combined for 18 catches for 274 yards and 2 touchdowns.  If there’s a weak spot on your defense, an elite quarterback will find it.  Even two great corners can be neutralized if you have poor safety play.  So my philosophy is not necessarily to find stars on defense, but to avoid having duds.  For me, it’s not as much about finding players to build around as avoiding to play guys that opposing quarterbacks will target.\n",
            "The same is true on the offensive line. The Jets have three Pro Bowl caliber players, but an awful right tackle made the entire unit mediocre.  Good defenses can scheme to attack your weakness on the line.  One star defensive player or offensive lineman isn’t that valuable, in my opinion.  They’re the classic “whole is greater than the sum of their parts.”\n",
            "On the other hand, one star offensive player, like a quarterback, can be a huge difference maker.  Combined with Graham and Cruz, and I have the foundation for an elite passing offense.  That might break with conventional wisdom, but it’s how I would manage this salary cap.\n",
            "How much of a priority did you place on special teams, considering the restrictions of the salary cap? How would you rate your special teams unit?\n",
            "Almost none.  I took Wallace Wright and James Ihedigbo because they can be good in punt and kick coverage, but also because they simply filled the roster spot.  I wanted good returners, and LaMichael James, T.Y. Hilton and Ted Ginn fit that bill. But individual kickers and punters are pretty meaningless to me in the grand scheme.  Special teams can be important, sure, but the problem is that special teams performances are wildly variant from year to year.  I’d much rather have a good special teams coach and have him figure out the rest.\n",
            "Here’s a quick test: name the kicker, punter, and special teams stars on the ‘60s Packers, ’70s Steelers, ’80s ‘49ers and ‘90s Cowboys.  That’s what I thought.\n",
            "Matt Waldman\n",

            "[…] RSP Writers Project: The Sporting News’ Russ Lande, Footballguys’ Chase Stuart, Pro Football Focus’ Sam Monson, and Bleacher Report’s Matt Miller have all unveiled […]\n",
            "Well, this is certainly a team that doesnt lack intrigue. Very interesting. Couple things that definitely stand out here and its definitely unique and has a certain flare to it.1) I’m all for the spend big on offense theory that goes back to Bill Polians model with Peyton Manning and his Colts. It might not be readily apparent at first, but thats basically a trend alot of teams these days are now following these days. The advancements in the game have made it so thats most beneficial to invest and try to generate top players at key offensive positions. Bill Belichick has quitely realized this the past decade and shifted the focus of the team. You see the same thing with the Detroit Lions who are basically replicating the Colts model from the past decade. The Green Bay Packers have really gone full throttle on this, creating a plethora of offensive talent while supplying Rodgers with plenty of attention up front and basically building a defense around a few stars and a bunch of not so stud type players if we’re being polite. The Saints have done this also. In general the trend youll notice now are the teams with the core of supreme offensive talent are the ones who have repeated success and the teams that rely on defense, special teams, running the ball and minimizing their QBs impact need everything to break right(think turnover difference injuries—–San Francisco and the Jets to name a few) tend to be the ones that come and go and dont have lasting success. This is a bit of a generalization; the Steelers will be everybodys quick counter to that and thats fine but the point still stands that if you can have your choice of doing whatever you want to build a team(and your not stuck in a position of trying to change a team thats been a defense oriented unit for so long like a lot of GMs are), then you take the chance to stockpile offensive talent.2) The receiving core is fascinating because the trio of Victor Cruz-Jimmy Graham-Torrey Smith is a deep threat trio, but presents problems vertically in 3 different ways. You have the seam physical monster in Graham whos still learning how to play and will attract rolling coverage everytime he goes up the seam and whos perfectly comfortable being flexed out as a receiver. Hes the jump ball threat people think of when they think of deep threats. Then you have Victor Cruz, the slot demon who can provide vertical threat with supreme acceleration and change of direction ability operating out of option routes from the slot. With him the entire field is a threat and with his route running and ball tracking skills hes about the only slot receiver in the NFL who truly demands bracket coverage(that includes Wes Welker your not bracketing Welker in a traditional sense when all his work is before 15 yards from the line). Then theres Torrey Smith, the burner and the go route specialist, “taking the top off the defense”. He’s limited with what he can do right now and theres no gurantee he fully develops(people just like to assume raw receivers will develop into far more complete players as they get older, doesnt always happen like that at all), but hes the type of player wholl cause every opposing coordinator fear because it takes too much out of your gameplan to consistently double and rotate coverage towards him, itll leave you too vulnerable in other areas and hes the third best option on this team—not the best use of resources, so your essentially forced to give him matchups hes capable of exploiting. He wont always do it but your at this teams mercy. He can be completely rendered for 85% of a game but 1-2 plays with him can turn everything. Your always at his mercy. Theres potentially a fourth deep threat with TY Hilton a good develomental prospect and I think Anquan Boldin could carve a few more years out of his career by being rendered a slot type receiver playing with a QB who can maximize slot receivers(think timing, anticipation, communication, basically what Peyton Manning has strived at his whole career and the type of things Joe Flacco can be a little inconsistent with)3) The decisions Chase has made here with his RBs also I think are the direction RB is heading towards in todays game. Its not necessairly a position of significantly declining importance, its role has just changed. Theyve become spatial players, chesspieces that can be used in a multitude of ways and the key with them is they can attack every part of the field. Thats why running back option routes have been a staple of the league for so long and why teams have really started amplifying the different number of ways to get them the ball. The direction towards the quicker scatbacks also allows them to run out of spread formations(so your not giving away anything about your play call before the snap) and dictate opposing personnel. He has a very solid trio with potential to work with here. Hes got 3 very good slot options, a true burner outside and then these explosive toys that can do a variety of things and attack every part of the field and play in any situation. Any offense with Peyton Manning is going to face alot of subpackages. These are exactly the kind of RBs you want for those situations because these players DEMAND attention by there very nature since they have so much open space and get tend to get the ball significantly more than any receiver.4) Its rather interesting how this defense was built; through corners and a hell of a prospect at safety in Eric Berry. The hope here is that young players can develop to form a pass rush. But its a very very risky appraoch because if McClellin and Curry dont develop(and these arent sure fire top 10 picks so its a very real possibility) then a defense built around a young secondary, no pass rush and what Chase admitted might be a bit shaky of a run defense is going to have problems. I’m not sure pass rush is the area in a 4-3 defense to be banking on unproven risky commodities in. Maybe in your case it might have been the best way to go, but its worth looking at closer.5) Furthermore this is a defense banking on 3 rookies with Caliborne, McClellin and Curry at absoultely crucial positions. And Eric Berry is also a bit of a prospect considering hes only had 16 games in the league. Thats 21.5 committed to 4 prospects at huge positions. And then the highest paid player on the unit Phil Taylor is another prospect who frankly didnt have a particuarly good rookie season which makes it up to 28.5(I’m really surprised with the Taylor selection. To spend 7 on someone who wasnt particulary good as a rookie and wasnt a top 20 pick…..ehhh. If you want a dominant defensive tackle up front there were many other options that are the best case possibility for Phil Taylor at a few dollars more.) If your not gonna spend that much on a defense its generally a good idea to go with young cheap prospects that have potential to be worth much more than there price tag. But the word cheap doesnt apply here with these prospects. Your banking on them to develop to their full potential. Thats always a risky proposition. Maybe the best way to go when you arent going to spend much on that side of the ball(or maybe not I’m not sure its up for debate) but rather risky.6) I raved about hte possibilities on offense earlier but let me throw out one caveat; theres no real X isolation receiver capable of consistently winning on the outside or if you want to really use cliches “being the true no 1 receiver”. We already talked about Torrey Smiths limitations. Jimmy Graham is a tight end, sure he can flex out and play snaps as a receiver, even an X isolated receiver in a 3X1 distirbution, but hes still a tight end whos more on the raw side. Victor Cruz is far and away his best in the slot. He can play outside  but thats not his niche and he isnt someone whos at his best trying to beat one on one coverage outside or being the focus of opposing game plans(he was largely taken away for long stretches in the playoffs once he started getting consistently bracketed). Anquan Boldin is also at his best in the slot. There are tight ends who run better than him; he doesn’t strike me as a guy Id want to ask to win one on one matchups outside. All these receiving optiosn have some limitations and have to be manipulated. Theres no receiver who is comfortable being isolated or really having to win on the outside consistently and against coverages focused at them. Peyton Manning can help camoflauge there weaknesses but only to a point and hes not the long term option at QB.7) I also liked the selections at RBs but i Don’t like the price tag. 11 for 3 RBs, none of whom strike as real feature RBs and who all have limitations. Hunter and James are both still relatively unproven in a way and theres a reason Pierre Thomas has never been a starter and that within teh past year the Saints signed Darren Sproles and traded away a first round pick to move up to get Mark Ingram. Its an expensive investment. There valuable players, but is the spot worth 11 on commodities with real question marks? I’m not sure that might have been the best use of money and if your going to spend 11 on RBs I might be inclined to spend big on one like a McCoy or Ray Rice and use a few dollars left over to get a respectable backup like a javon Ringer, Chris Ivory or Bernard Scott. Just something to think about.8) Last thing and this is the one real question I have. You say this is a team built to win now in your Ike Taylor comment. But look at how many unproven commodities you have at key positions. Your WR group is very young and while theyve all had success, your banking on all of them probably improving. Your LT is a rookie with question marks. Your key cogs on defense are almost all unproven(Taylor, your 2 pass rushers, Claiborne and to a lesser extent Berry). Is that really the direction of a team built to win now? The thing is, if Peyton Manning is your QB, you have to be in win now mode given his recent past and age. Its just that the way the defense is built and other positions like LT, RB and to a lesser extent WR, that this is a rather risky way to approach to win now with. I think the strategy here is value; to get guys that exceed their price tag in a few years, especially on defense. The thing is that few years it might take them. Rookies with Pro Bowl potential usually dont play like pro bowlers there rookie year, if at all. Thats the only real question I have is the direction of the team and the plan long term with Peyton Manning really probably going to be around for 2 and at hte absolute most 3 years. This offense is so dependent on him it needs a good predecessor and I’m not sure Id want to put faith in Colt McCoy to be that guy. All in all though, very interesting, definitely some good ideas put in place and some ideas that I wouldnt have thought of. Well done and a good read for sure.\n",

            "By Jeremy Gottlieb, Patriots Daily Professor\n",
            "Well, then. Now that almost 48 full hours have passed and all of us have likely caught our breath, we can examine more clearly and coherently then Patriots stirring, improbable, 23-20 win over the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship. The win, which sends the Pats to their seventh Super Bowl and fifth under the magical tandem of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady (the most of any QB/coach combo of all time), was maddening, scintillating, ugly, glorious and completely perplexing, sometimes all at once. The Pats won with defense and physicality and if you had that one down headed into the game, I’ve got some lottery numbers for you to play (I’ll throw in a healthy commission for your trouble), with Brady playing one of his worst games of the season and the team losing three turnovers but somehow getting away with it. Multiple defensive guys had huge days and when you take that, some strong, powerful running by the Law Firm of BenJarvus Green-Ellis, more of the same mental toughness this team has shown all year and at least a spoonful of luck (fear not, we’ll get to the missed, 32-yard field goal, also known as the biggest gag job I’ve ever seen), it all adds up to a trip to the big game 12 days from now in Indianapolis. So with that, let’s get to this week’s report card, all dressed up and ready for the dance.\n",
            "OFFENSE: C+Quarterbacks: CBefore we go any further, let’s get this out of the way: Brady is as tough, if not tougher than any QB in the NFL. On his fourth quarter, one-yard TD plunge, he was upside down in midair when he was blasted in the kidneys and lower back by the helmet and shoulder pads of none other than Ravens all-time linebacker Ray Lewis. And not only did he hold on to the ball, securing the points that would prove to be the difference in the game, he got right up, spiked the ball Gronk-styles and jogged to the sideline. It hurt just watching that play but if Brady was affected, no one either in Gillette Stadium or watching the game on TV knew it. Now, bearing that in mind, Brady pretty much sucked otherwise, just as he said on the podium after the game. He routinely missed open receivers. He was skittish and happy footed at times. He threw two interceptions and had two other ones nullified by penalties. His fourth quarter pick, one play after Brandon Spikes made one of the plays of the game, on which he needlessly forced a bomb into double coverage (intended for Matthew Slater of all people) was something you would never in your wildest dreams imagine seeing him do let alone in the fourth quarter of the AFC Championship with a three-point lead. He finished 22-of-36 for 239 yards (6.6 YPA), zero TDs (the first time that’s happened in the playoffs since the 2002 AFC Championship game in Pittsburgh) and the two picks, all good for a woeful 57.5 passer rating. He was outplayed by Ravens QB Joe Flacco (??!!). But hey, the Pats won and if we know Brady,, who tied Joe Montana for the most post-season wins by a QB of all time, this performance will motivate him to no end come Feb. 5. Let’s chalk this one up to a fluke, an aberration, a one-time thing. There’s still no one Pats fans would rather have.\n",
            "Running Backs: BGreen-Ellis was a big factor all day despite splitting reps almost completely evenly with Danny Woodhead. It was a vintage, head down, straight ahead running kind of day for the Law Firm, who pounded his way to 68 yards and a TD on 15 carries. On one play, he got his helmet completely twisted around and ripped off, forcing him to go to the ground coconut unprotected, yet another display of the team’s overall toughness Most of the Pats success running the ball came on draws out of the shotgun with the Ravens D spread out and expecting the pass; the more traditional stuff was swallowed up with relative ease. But Benny did his part and then some. Woodhead was quiet save for once nice draw and Aaron Hernandez failed to replicate his monstrous efforts out of the backfield from the Divisional round win over Denver. And our binky Stevan Ridley sat this one out after fumbles in consecutive games, though given the Pats opponent in the Super Bowl, the New York Giants, he will likely be needed. The Giants have a ferocious pass rush and the Pats would be wise to run the ball a healthy amount in order to help neutralize it. On Sunday, Benny looked like he’ll be up to that challenge.\n",
            "Wide Receivers: B-This one was mostly the Wes Welker show again, with Deion Branch making two catches for 18 yards and everyone else doing mostly nothing (Julian Edelman caught one pass for eight yards). Welker had a couple of missteps (one drop, one slip, one deflection that turned into a pick that was luckily wiped out by a penalty) but was still his usual, dependable self. He finished with six catches for 53 yards, got the snot beaten out of him once again and naturally, a couple of his grabs resulted in enormously important first downs. At this point, as has been the case for several weeks now, Welker pretty much is the receiving corps. Any time Branch can put up an effort like last week against the Broncos (three catches, 85 yards, that amazing, 61-yard TD), it’s a bonus. This is Welker’s group. Everyone else (except Chad Ochocinco who may as well get cut before the Super Bowl if for no other reason than that he’ll be a distraction on Media Day getting asked over and over again why he is so awful, he doesn’t even dress for the biggest game of the year) is just renting.\n",
            "Tight Ends: B+Not quite the usual game-breaking day for A-Herb or Rob Gronkowski but solid nonetheless. Once again, the focal point of the Pats offense, they combined for 12 catches and 153 yards, though neither of them found the end zone. Gronk, who suffered a rough looking ankle injury late in the game but returned after missing just nine snaps, was immense in other areas than just catching the ball as he often is, at one point absolutely destroying Ravens pass rushing demon Terrell Suggs while staying home to block. And his first play back after leaving because of that ankle? He’s throwing a key block on Brady’s TD leap. These two guys are monsters, as we all know. But now that we’ve reached the final game, the biggest game, maybe we should look at them in the bigger picture. The bottom line is, in an amazing, exhilarating season filled with major moments and major performances, Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez have become the most important cogs in the Pats offensive machine whose names are not Tom Brady. And they’re both just in their second year. Unbelievable.\n",
            "Offensive Line: AHave to hand it to Matt Light; in what is probably the best season of his career, he just keeps getting better and better. Every week, it seems, there’s some stud, maniac pass rusher on his side and every week, that stud, maniac pass rusher is rendered an afterthought. On Sunday, it was Suggs, who had 14 sacks during the regular season and has garnered some sincere talk about being named Defensive Player of the Year. Against Light, he had two tackles. Period. That’s two. No sacks. Maybe once, he got within a yard and a half of Brady. And that’s it. The O-line is the core of this team and on Sunday, it stepped up and then some. And not just Light, either. Brian Waters, the best free agent signing this team has made in quite some time, was tasked with bottling up Ravens nose man Haloti Ngata and did just that. Logan Mankins once again shook off his late season knee injury to play a complete, spotless game. Nate Solder had the only blemish, getting beaten to the outside and allowing Baltimore’s only sack to someone named Paul Kruger, not exactly one of the Ravens big names on D. It was a fantastic performance and one that will certainly need to be duplicated in the Super Bowl against the Giants pass rush. The O-line’s inability to handle that same front four in Super Bowl XLII was one of the biggest reasons the Pats lost that game. If Sunday against the Ravens similarly fearsome D is any indication, this time around, this group will be ready.\n",
            "DEFENSE: B+Defensive Line: AAnyone out there own a Vince Wilfork jersey? Cause I’ll buy it off you. That’s how valuable that thing has to be after Sunday. Wilfork, one of the best, most important Pats of the past decade, played the game of his life against the Ravens, making plays against the run and the pass, wreaking havoc and at one crucial point late in the fourth quarter, single-handedly taking over. On the Ravens second to last possession of the night, with a third-and-3 from his team’s 30, he blasted through the line to wrap up Baltimore’s star back Ray Rice with one arm, dragging him to the turf with one arm for a three-yard loss (a massive stupid play call by the Ravens by the way, but that’s another conversation). The Ravens then decided to go for it rather than try a 50-yard field goal (a decision that obviously makes a hell of a lot of sense now), so Big Vince simply steamrolled center Matt Birk right into Flacco’s grill, taking the QB to his knees while still carrying the giant O-lineman, forcing Flacco to lob the ball to no one and turn the ball over on downs. It was the most dominant sequence any Pats defensive player has displayed in ages when you factor in the situation and circumstances. And it’s fitting that Wilfork, one of the longest tenured, core members of the organization, was responsible for it. And that’s not even getting into some of the stuff he did earlier in the game, which he ended with the following stat line: six tackles, three for a loss, one sack, and another hit on the QB. And he did it all while missing just three of 73 snaps. Outstanding. Everyone else up front played well too; Mark Anderson got pressure on Flacco a fair amount of times and played the run well. Brandon Deaderick plugged up space and both Gerard Warren and Kyle Love played roles in holding Rice, who came in leading the league in total yards from scrimmage, to just 67 yards on 22 carries and only one catch for 11 yards. When this group plays this well and is able to physically overmatch its opponent, it takes so much pressure off of the secondary and makes life easier for everyone. It’s hard to imagine them doing that any better than they did on Sunday.\n",
            "Linebackers: BGood for Brandon Spikes. He’s still working his way back from that knee injury suffered against the Giants the last time they played the Pats, but man are his fresh legs a wonder. He made nine tackles on Sunday, a huge part of the defense slowing down the Rice and the Ravens rushing attack. But his finest moment, as well as what was for about three minutes the play of the game, came on a passing play. Spikes intercepted a fourth quarter Flacco pass by simply staying in his land, trailing the tight end as underneath help for the safety and making an awesomely athletic play, extending one of his big paws just enough to snag the darted throw and reel it in. It was a sensational interception; not only did it come out of almost nowhere and was it such a cool display of athleticism, but the timing was perfect. It’s great to see Spikes make plays like that when he gets to stay on the field in passing situations. He’s getting closer to becoming an all-around backer. If he can stay healthy and out of trouble, watch out. Jerod Mayo was solid, not great and that seems to be his M.O., which is OK. He made a couple of big hits and looked very impactful at times yet was doing the chasing, flailing thing a couple times too. It was a mostly typical day for him. And Rob Ninkovich continued to be the second coming of Mike Vrabel; he got to Flacco once (along with James Ihedigbo) and was great against the run, combining with Anderson to do good work taking away the edges. And Dane Fletcher was active and aggressive in limited time. The Pats defense is healthy and coming together at the most opportune time possible. The linebacking corps is no exception.\n",
            "Defensive Backs: A-Go ahead, try to start an argument on this one. If you think that more attention should be paid to Flacco playing one of the best games of his career (22-of-36, 306 yards, two TDs, 95.4 passer rating) and torching the secondary down the stretch than to Sterling Moore’s two season-saving plays, more power to you. Because if Moore hadn’t knocked away a sure TD pass to Lee Evans on Baltimore’s second to last defensive play of the day (a play on which Evans was completely complicit) or broken up what would have been a first down throw to tight end Dennis Pitta on the next play, we wouldn’t be having this little chat. Moore was almost as much a hero on this day as Wilfork and more power to him. He’s yet another one of Belichick’s collection of undrafted, unheralded, never-heard-of DBs who rose above the rest of them to become one of the biggest reasons this team is going to the Super Bowl. Gotta love it. Things were OK elsewhere despite the yardage totals and the Ravens success on third down (nine of their last 14); Patrick Chung wore the goat horns on a 42-yard pass play to Ravens deep threat Torrey Smith. Kyle Arrington missed a chunk of time with an eye injury, but was pretty good. Devin McCourty saw more time at safety and also could share some blame on that throw to Smith (as well as a 29-yard catch and run for a TD also by Smith) but managed to make it through another week without humiliating himself. Ihedigbo had that sack with Ninkovich on a nifty, delayed blitz and added eight tackles including one for a loss. And Edelman got matched up with the Ravens best receiver Anquan Boldin, and was burned more than once but completely lucked out that Baltimore’s offensive coaches were too stupid recognize the matchup until the final five minutes. It’s going to be interesting to see how this group deals with the Giants receivers, two of whom (Hakeem Nicks and Victor Cruz) are absolute studs (and for the purposes of this discussion, let’s say interesting means terrifying). But we’ll worry about that next week. For now, let’s continue to celebrate Moore. What a couple of huge, huge plays. Hallelujah.\n",
            "Special Teams: CYikes. In what could have been a disaster, Woodhead fumbled a kick return at his own 30 following a long Ravens TD drive that gave them their first lead of the game. Luckily for him, the Pats defense came up with one of its best, stiffest stops of the evening afterward, keeping the Ravens from a first down and forcing them into a field goal that made the game 20-16, setting the stage for the Pats to reclaim the lead on their next possession. There was Woody again on the ensuing kick, running another one back, which was a big surprise, especially seeing as how Ridley had been banished for his fumble-itis and neither of those were half as costly. Anyway, it was a huge bullet dodged. The Pats have been pretty much nowhere in their return game all year but have gotten away with it. You have to wonder if Woody will be back there again next Sunday in Indy. As for the kicking game, Stephen Gostkowski was 3-for-3 on field goals and only had one kickoff returned all day and our man Zoltan blasted two punts for an average of just under 50 yards per. Job well done.\n",
            "Coaching: B+Maybe this grade should be a bit lower. Some of the play calling, particularly down the stretch, was questionable and that’s being friendly. The bomb to Slater made little sense at the time, even less so when it was picked off. And when the Pats got the ball back following the Ravens failed, fourth down conversion attempt, they went three-and-out with a chance to salt the game away, with a couple of real head-scratchers (a toss play to Benny on 2nd and 4?) included. But in the end, this grade is a testament to how ready Belichick had this defense ready to play. The Pats were on their heels on defense all year but allowed just 30 points in two playoff games and had guys making plays everywhere both weeks. There may not have been too many name guys out there, especially in the secondary, but they were Belichick’s guys, tough guys, guys who took his coaching and got better every single week. And now, the Pats have won 10 straight games and are going back to the Super Bowl. It’s pretty unreal. We could harp some more on the play-calling. Or we could do a comparison with the coaching on the Ravens sideline (so so poor in the fourth quarter in so many ways that it warrants its own 3,000 word column). But why bother? This season was arguably the best job of Belichick’s career. Let’s just leave it at that.\n",

            "The other I saw while there was the absolute mugging that Wes Welker gets, esp. when the ball doesn’t come his way. I think the refs are afraid to make a call away from the ball in the post season, and it really hurts us. Several plays I would see Welker get completely wrapped up a good 10 yds downfield. Reminds me of the 2001 Pats and what they did to the Rams receivers, only getting called the once on McGinnest. That has me worried.\n",

            "Danny Woodhead is learning the kick-off return role and is a work in progress. One fumble in that capacity does not a failure make. Danny will learn from it and make the needed adjustment. It is obvious that the coaching staff has great confidence in Woody in that they put him right back in the same position for a nifty and sizeable return. That speaks highly of Danny’s abilities to run the ball back in the maze of 11 defenders whose sole purpose is to destroy you. Even the fumble return was a significant gain before the ball was pulled out of his grip. Danny is improving in that role game by game, so quit the rush to judgment Jeremy and loosen up……Jeremy, you did not speak postively of Danny as a running back either. How could you when Obrien stupidly keeps running Danny up the gut all year long- i.e. 6 times against the Ravens. Danny is not an up-the-gut buster or Law Firm clone as Obrien seems to think and tries to make him. Danny is a lethal perimeter runner and short pass receiver, and has been used in neither of his gifted capacities since the playoff loss to the Jets last year when Obrien dumbly ran him up the middle ad nauseum. It didn’t work and the Pats lost. The 928 yard, 6 touchdown Danny Woodhead of 2010-11 has all but disappeared in 2011-12 because Obrien gut busts him and seldom if ever has Brady making passes to him……Jeremy, what you should be asking yourself is how can it be that the lethal replacement for Kevin Faulk last year could be reduced to such sub-parness and non-lethality this year. The answer is Bill Obrien,and the tragic wasting and misuse of Dannhy Woiodhead will not stop until Obrien is finally in Happy Valley.\n",

            "I watched the TV copy last night and it looked to me like Brady was just a bit off. I didn’t see him feeling paranoid about the rush, like we’ve seen a handful of times over the years. There were throws like the one to a wide-open Gronk, the one he led Hernandez too much down the seam and the one behind Welker that was picked. The throw seemed rushed because he felt he need to thread the needle, more than he was concerned about getting hit. The one to Gronk in particular he had no rush and seemed more shocked that Reed bit on the fake, that he rushed it too much.\n",
            "LikeLike\n",
            "This season is playing out exactly like the 2006 Colts season.  The Colts ran up their usual 12-4 record, but nobody took them seriously all year because of their defense.  But then the playoffs came around and the defense began making more plays than the offense.  People are getting on Brady for his statistically bad game vs. Baltimore, but miss the fact that he made huge, game winning plays.  Manning had the same criticism in 2006 and actually had his worst postseason of his career (if you go by numbers).  Seriously, look at the scores of their 4 playoff games.  Not Manning/Colts-like at all.  Again, Manning made “winning” plays when he had to that year.\n",
            "I believe it’s playing out the same way for the Patriots, with the much maligned defense STILL getting no respect.  With the opponent supposedly having a “ferocious” and “unstoppable” defense (Bears in 2006, Giants now).  Mark my words, the Pats D will end up making more plays in the Super Bowl and the MVP will come from the Defense.\n",

            "Heck, if just two weeks ago, Joe Flacco or Alex Smith had played the same gameTom Bradyplayed last Sunday, the talking heads would have skewered them for the bonehead decisions and poorly thrown passes.\n",

            "And yes, they got it done, and that's all that matters.\n",

            "Then on third down, Flacco ran along the line of scrimmage disdaining an easy first down and at least two more, maybe three, attempts at winning in regulation, and instead elected to throw a low-percentage pass that wouldn't have resulted in a score anyway.And the other team won because the team they were playing, a team that committed only 11 turnovers in 17 games, muffed two—two!—punts in the final 16 minutes of the game.\n",

            "But, as they say, that's why you play the games.\n",
            "Alright, there's no arguing that the Giants and Patriots earned the right to be there.\n",
            "And they gave us a heck of a show.\n",
            "Exciting. Tense. Down to the final play, the outcome still in doubt.\n",

            "If Tom Brady weren't, well, Tom Brady, how much grief would he have caught for the bonehead safety?\n",
            "And let's just focus on two passes. First, the interception on the deep attempt to Gronkowski. The play had all the makings to land itself on Super Bowl highlight films forever. First, Brady, not a scrambler, manages to duck under and elude a heavy Giant pass-rush. He sets his feet, scans the field and then heaves it deep. Tell the truth, didn't you expect to see a wide open Patriot either streaking to the end zone or waiting all alone at the five?Instead, what we saw was a well-covered receiver (Gronkowski) having no chance of fighting back through Chase Blackburn, possibly the largest man (6'3\" and 247 lbs) to ever be the deepest defender on an NFL play, for a badly underthrown (and intercepted) pass.\n",
            "\n",
            "But most of America's opinion was influenced by talking head, Cris Collinsworth, who declared that Gronkowski didn't \"help out\" Brady!\n",
            "America heard the same ridiculous sort of comment when Brady missedWes Welkerwith just over four minutes left in the game on a play that at minimum would have retained possession for the Patriots, likely would have resulted in at least a field goal and may have led to a game-clinching touchdown.\n",
            "Was the pass catchable? Yes. But 999 out of 1000 times, as Collinsworth claimed, or Welker graciously stated after the game? Not a chance.\n",
            "Brady left the pass short and behind Welker. This wasn't an intentional \"back shoulder\" pass. Welker had room to the middle of the field as the Giants safety was late in reacting.\n",
            "It was simply a bad pass on a play that might have clinched a Super Bowl victory for New England.\n",
            "When I stated my opinion that Brady had played poorly to my favorite bartender the day after the game, he said, \"But he completed 16 passes in a row!\"  And he's right, he did.\n",
            "But Tom Brady came up short on the day the very best are supposed to excel.\n",
            "Eli Manningdidn't excel, either. What he did was win.\n",
            "The Giants offense found the end zone early, thanks to the negation of a New England interception for having 12 men on the field (a penalty the Giants were also guilty of on the next-to-last play of the game, giving the Patriots five yards that helped Brady throw a perfect Hail Mary into the end zone on the last play).\n",
            "And, to their credit, they found it late.\n",
            "If this had been that aforementioned November game between Cincinnati and Tennessee, it would have already been forgotten.\n",
            "But, it was on the biggest stage for the grandest prize in all of sports, and thus goes down as a \"memorable\" Super Bowl.\n",
            "What I'll always remember is it was the strangest way I've ever seen a team get to 21.\n",
            "Anyone remember what you felt like after the opening drive?\n",
            "I’m struggling to think of a recent Seahawks performance quite as messy as this. There were games in the Mora era where the Seahawks just flat out bailed after going behind early, and there were some heavy defeats in the early Carroll days. This is much more frustrating. The team should be beyond the kind of basic errors we saw today. The Rams didn’t score an offensive touchdown, relied on long-range field goals and surrendered a big touchdown drive to start the game. And they still won comfortably.\n",
            "This is a defensive unit that consistently flirts with elite status. Man for man, it’s a group that matches up to any in the league. So why can’t they defend third and long? Time and time again, drives against the Cowboys and Rams have been extended after the opponent reached 3rd and 10 or greater. It’s a complete head scratcher. Without going through each play today or against Dallas, it’s hard to work out what the problem is. It’s not an issue defending the screen, something we saw regularly in 201 to extend drives on third and long. It isn’t a draw play or underneath throw that is gashing the team. It appears to be pretty basic – Bradford/Romo dropped back and found open receivers in man-to-man coverage. Are the Seahawks using extra guys in the secondary? You presume so. What’s happening here? If the defense is going to live up to rising expectations, they have to get it done on third and long.\n",
            "Penalties are killing the Seahawks. The coaches’ stress discipline so much, so why is this continuing to happen? Breno Giacomini is a walking 15-yard penalty. It seems like certain players are taking risks pretty much on every drive, chipping after the whistle or making unnecessary moves towards an opponent. The false start issues didn’t re-appear today but they were replaced by a few other costly flags. The message isn’t getting through here. Some are blaming the coaches, but they preach itsomuch. Eventually the players are just going to have to engage their brains or take a seat on the sidelines. It’s far too costly and Seattle remains one of the most penalised teams in the NFL.\n",
            "I’m not going to blame Russell Wilson too much for this defeat. There is a ‘but…’ however. Of the three interceptions he had, one pass should’ve been caught by a receiver and a tight end tripped up leading to another. The other pick came on a cornerback blitz that he really should’ve done a better job handling. Janoris Jenkins moved inside and left a receiver open to the left, but Wilson checked to two options on the right, was hit by Jenkins and the ball was picked. React, get the ball to the left quickly and take what’s on offer. The concern I have with Wilson is a pretty big one. In four starts so far he hasreallystruggled to sit in the pocket and make plays. On the penultimate drive he had pretty good protection on third down, but still panicked too quickly and left the pocket. He was sacked scrambling around trying to find space to throw.\n",
            "Time and time again he’s leaving the pocket too quickly. If Wilson is ever going to make it as a long term starter, he has to be able to sit in the pocket and make reads. Right now he simply isn’t doing that. I’m not sure whether replacing him is the answer because you might end up switching one issue for another. For every play Wilson gets panicky and leaves the pocket, there’s a play where his superior mobility is a factor. It’s harsh to judge a rookie too early but I think we’re moving into the territory now where we don’t assume Wilson is the answer. For me, the Seahawks have made their bed and need to keep rolling with the guy and hope he improves. But for the first time this season the thought of going back to scouting quarterbacks crossed my mind.\n",
            "Play calling is still a frustrating issue. Seattle ran the ball well all day and with the score at 16-13 were in the red zone at 3rd and 2. They called a QB draw. If you’re going to run, then run with Marshawn Lynch. If you’re going to throw, then throw the ball. Calling a QB draw was beyond getting cute. It reminded me of the option play on Monday against Green Bay (also on third down). Why get so intricate like that? It’s not a trick play, it’s not just solid football and let them stop you. I don’t understand either call.\n",
            "On the whole the Seahawks are playing a brand of football that basically compensates for a total lack of a passing game. When the defense, special teams and run game click – they look like a very good team. Yet if one area doesn’t quite have a great day, another unit has to compensate to make up for it. The passing game cannot do that yet. What’s more, they don’t score cheap points. Getting a touchdown seems like a chore for this team – the red zone a place of dread. The passing game needs a complete overhaul and review in the off-season – it cannot be a complimentary piece. By all means create a dominating ground game – but it cannot be your entire identity. Balance must be found.\n",
            "In 2010, Matt Hasselbeck had only 12 touchdowns and ranked way down the list for QB rating. He had 17 turnovers. Taravaris Jackson had just 14 touchdowns, 13 picks and again was way down the list for QB rating. Russell Wilson appears set to make it an unwelcome hat-trick of bad production for the position.\n",
            "The Seahawks are a fortunate 2-2 but look more like the 1-3 team they probably should be. This could be a frustrating year overall, with some annoying defeats like this one and some equally tense victories down the road. But it still looks like a team that is going to be around eight wins. Maybe they go 7-9 again, maybe they edge to a winning record at 9-7? Everyone can see that the team is improving in certain areas, but if it’s going to break from mediocrity and become a contender the Seattle Seahawksneeda passing game. The front office has to make it as much of a priority as the running game, offensive line, pass rush and secondary – all areas that have improved since the Pete Carroll era began.\n",
            "List of priorities for the off season:\n",
            "1. Passing game\n",
            "End.\n",
            "This guy is playing pretty well right now...\n",
            "Two games kind of stand out this weekend. Firstly, Baylor’s defense did a great job boosting Geno Smith’s Heisman campaign. Then Georgia and Tennessee, perhaps inspired by the efforts of WVU and BU, decided they’d give the defense a weekend off too.\n",
            "Geno Smith gaining momentum\n",
            "No prizes for guessing who’s the Heisman front-runner at this stage. Geno Smith scored eight passing touchdowns against Baylor, recorded 656 yards, completed 45 passes and even added 31 yards rushing. After four games he has 21 total touchdowns and zero turnovers. Tougher games are on the horizon and he’s going to have to avoid the occasional off-day he experienced last year (see: Syracuse) but there’s no doubting he’s a talented quarterback with pro-potential. His deep accuracy has always been pretty good and he’s above average in most of the key areas – arm strength, athleticism, accuracy and field IQ. He does everything pretty well and when you look at him physically, you wonder if he’s only scratching the surface of his potential. Realistically he could improve his upper body strength without getting too big to improve his throwing velocity even further.\n",
            "In terms of the draft, perhaps the most important thing isn’t so much how well Smith is playing – but the way other quarterbacks aren’t. Matt Barkley hasn’t been at his best in the last two weeks. Tyler Wilson’s season is imploding at Arkansas. Logan Thomas lost again today and won’t declare. Aaron Murray looks sharp but lacks the physical tools to make him a top pick. Right now Smith is the only guy with any momentum. Teams will realise he’s playing in a prolific scheme, but it’s the same scheme that pushed soon-to-be 29-year-old quarterback Brandon Weeden into the first round. If he can keep winning and keep up the production, Smith will be in contention to be the first quarterback off the board.\n",
            "Of course, it helps having a pair of talented wide outs. Tavon Austin again looked spectacular – recording 14 catches and 215 yards plus a couple of scores. In the last two games he has 27 catches, five touchdowns and 394 yards. Austin could be Smith’s answer to Kendall Wright and certainly the RGIII-to-Wright connection helped both players in the 2012 draft. For all Austin’s lack of size, he’s an electric playmaker. Don’t sleep on the other WVU wide-out Stedman Bailey. He also lacks size at around 5-10, but it’s hard to ignore a 13-catch, 303 yard performance including five touchdowns. Crazy numbers.\n",
            "And while we’re talking about receivers, let’s also touch on Terrance Williams at Baylor. We highlighted him over the summer and he’s started the year well – culminating in an even better yardage display than Bailey this afternoon. He had 17 catches against WVU, 314 yards and two touchdowns. He has 667 yards and six touchdowns in four games. There might not be a Julio Jones or A.J. Green among the 2013 receiving class, but there’s a fair amount of depth.\n",
            "Georgia’s defense struggles, apart from one player\n",
            "Alec Ogletree has missed games at Georgia for a variety of reasons. He missed a game in 2010 through suspension after being arrested and charged with misdemeanor theft stemming from an incident involving a stolen scooter helmet (OK….). He missed six games in 2011 with a broken foot. Georgia suspended him again this year for four games after he failed a drugs test. This is a guy with baggage. This is also a guy who can play the linebacker position very, very well.\n",
            "On a night where defense was an afterthought, Ogletree stood out. More so than superstar pass rusher Jarvis Jones who was a non-factor, or the massive interior presence of Jonathan Jenkins. He led the team in tackles on the night and played a solid game without error. He also flashed great athleticism, charging from sideline-to-sideline and tipping a pass at full stretch into the hands of safety Damian Swann. The off-field concerns are a major red flag, especially for a guy who will likely be expected to make a lot of defensive calls at linebacker. Even so, it’s hard to ignore him when he plays like this. Put the guy in a good locker room and he’s going to be a great pro.\n",
            "Jarvis Jones struggled to have an impact and it’ll raise concerns that others have voiced in the past. He’s had dominating games in his career, but rarely on the big occasions. When his team needed plays on defense he couldn’t avoid double teams or find a way to get involved. Tennessee has one of the best overall offensive lines in college football with legit pro-talent, but Jones still needs to flash in a game like this. He’ll have plenty of other opportunities in 2012 to prove this was just an off-night.\n",
            "On the other side of the ball, Aaron Murray continues to impress. He had an interception on a tipped pass, but he looked assured apart from that. I particularly liked his decision making and execution shown in tough spots – at one stage he wanted to throw deep down the right but rejected it, moved inside and threw a dart into a tight window. The receiver didn’t get the pass but it was a perfect throw and decision. He’s not a bad athlete but he’s more mobile than athletic. He hasn’t got ideal physical attributes but he has plenty of zip when required, but he’s probably maxed out in that sense. Can he be effective at the next level? It’s something I’m still trying to work out, but I wouldn’t rule it out.\n",
            "It was an odd night for Tennessee’s offense, lurching between elite and nightmarish equally. They ended the game with three Tyler Bray turnovers. Bray is a natural passer who looks really impressive at times, throwing bombs around the field. He’s got a bit of Brock Osweiler to his game with an awkward throwing motion and he’s tall and thin. He’s much more erratic than Osweiler, who actually had a good college career until the wheels came off at Arizona State. The best way to describe it is – he has the Jay Cutler disease. Natural passer, looks great on form – but he has moments in a game where he falls apart and he can’t get it back. Cutler, technically, has always been on a different level because Bray is slingy with his release, he gets into difficult throwing positions due to bad footwork and he too often steps backwards before throwing off-balance. He won’t get away with that when scouts watch the tape.\n",
            "Receiver Cordarrelle Patterson showed the best and worst of his game on the night. In the first half he had a horrendous drop on a deep pass, beating his man and needing only to catch the ball for a long touchdown. The concentration dipped, he dropped the football and it was a huge error. Last week he practically disappeared from the Akron game after a mistake led to a pick-six, and the same almost happened again tonight. He had just two catches – both in the dying embers of the game – for 31 yards in safe coverage. And just when you’re ready to write the guy off as a possible high pick, he runs a reverse to the house for a 46 yard touchdown. He’s an extreme playmaker with the ball in his hands, physically he’s superior to any other 2013 eligible receiver. And yet you still feel he’s a long way away from being an effective pro. He’s not a mature guy and maybe that has an impact on the little mental mistakes? Even so, he has incredible potential. He’s just a risky project.\n",
            "It wasn’t a good night for Justin Hunter, who was ignored for most of the game. He ended with three catches for 46 yards. Tonight’s showing won’t convince anyone he’s back to 100% after recovering from a serious knee injury.\n",
            "Elsewhere…\n",
            "We highlighted Missouri defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson this week – and he was at it again today. He had nine tackles, forced a fumble and recorded a sack against Central Florida. He’s a classic three technique prospect and will be rising up a lot of draft boards. One to definitely watch for the Seahawks.\n",
            "Logan Thomas struggled again and almost certainly won’t declare for 2013. The Virginia Tech quarterback had two picks, two total touchdowns and 242 passing yards completing 17/30. But most importantly, he couldn’t lead a talented VT team past Cincinnati and it’s now two recent defeats to opponents he should be beating. One of the big disappointments of 2012 so far.\n",
            "Clemson receiver DeAndre Hopkins did his best to keep up with some of the crazy numbers today. He caught 11 passes for 197 yards and a touchdown as the Tigers won 45-31 at Boston College. Running back Andre Ellington had 25 carries for 131 yards and a score.\n",
            "Keenan Allen is still suffering with middling quarterback play at California. He had a big 44 yard pass play in defeat to Arizona State, but he ended with just four catches for 79 yards and a touchdown. The combine will determine his draft fate.\n",
            "Tyler Wilson won’t be sending a Christmas card to Bobby Petrino this year. Arkansas is a complete shambles – the latest example a 58-10 defeat to Texas A&M. Wilson threw two bad picks and finished with 29/59 passing, 373 yards and a score. On the plus side, Knile Davis looked sharp on the touchdown pass, sprinting through tackles and looking somewhere back to his best. Unfortunately he also fumbled twice. Receiver Cobi Hamilton kept up his good form with 11 catches for 162 yards. Aggies defensive end Damontre Moore looked superb – he was a terror off the edge in the parts of the game I saw, forcing a fumble that was returned for a touchdown and getting a sack. I want to see more of this guy because he has first round potential.\n",
            "North Carolina defensive tackle Sylvester Williams had another sack in a blow-out victory over Idaho. He now has 4.5 sacks in five games. He’s an older guy due to his JUCO roots, but he’s still one to watch. Underrated.\n",

            "The Bulldogs are intense this year and determined to have an impact in the SEC. They feel it’stheirtime. The defense is filled with NFL talent and Aaron Murray is putting together a solid Heisman campaign. It’s another opportunity for Jarvis Jones (DE, LB) to show what he can do as a pass rusher and playmaker – Jones could be the top 2013 eligible player at any position and the #1 pick next year. Jonathan Jenkins has tremendous potential as a nose tackle and he’s well supported by the underrated Abry Jones on the defensive line. Linebacker Alec Ogletree hasn’t received much hype after missing the start of the season, but he’s also a NFL talent. Defensive backs Shawn Williams and Baccari Rambo are also worth watching.\n",
            "Aaron Murray is really hoping Russell Wilson blossoms as a starter this year. At around 6-1 Murray is taller than Wilson but will suffer from the same level of scepticism. At times he looks like a fine prospect, dissecting a defense like a surgeon while also showing enough athletic ability to make plays outside of the pocket. Then there are other games where he struggles – badly. So far he’s had a very good 2012, but to get around a lack of ideal physical attributes he’s going to need guys like Wilson to step up. If he does, and if Murray continues to perform, he could be a first or second round pick. It’s still a big ‘if’ at this stage. Wilson isn’t just playing to prove critics wrong in Seattle, he’s playing to change the way people think about quarterbacks.\n",
            "Tennessee’s best prospects are on offense and the passing game, so it’ll be good to see how they match up against the talented Georgia unit. Tyler Bray is a gun-slinger without ideal mechanics or footwork. Reports also say he’s not the most natural leader – and it’s hard to forget his first bowl game as a freshman, which included tears after mistakes and a bizarre throat-slitting celebration every time he scored a touchdown. He is a natural passer though and can only boost his stock by winning games like this. He can’t complain about the options he has at receiver. Despite losing Da’Rick Rogers (who is doing pretty well at Tennessee Tech, as it happens), he’s inherited Cordarrelle Patterson. Last week was a down week for Patterson, who did a bad job on a route leading to a pick six against Akron and his quarterback didn’t let him forget it. He’s too much of a talent to ignore in this one though, so expect Patterson to get a lot of looks. He’s big, fast, strong and a playmaker. He’ll play opposite Justin Hunter who is still looking pretty consistent after returning from a serious knee injury. He’s also perhaps the most complete receiver eligible for 2013.\n",
            "Ole Miss at Alabama\n",
            "This is probably going to be a very easy victory for the Crimson Tide – Ole Miss’ best draft prospect might be punter Tyler Campbell. Alabama has no such concerns. A.J. McCarron is an underrated quarterback who benefits from a dominating ground game anchored by brilliant guard prospect Chance Warmack and versatile center Barrett Jones. I don’t expect to learn much from this game, rather than sit back and simply enjoy watching the best college team dominate. Aside from the names mentioned, ‘Bama also has the best 2013 eligible cornerback in Dee Milliner, a solid defensive tackle in Jesse Williams and an athletic linebacker in C.J. Mosley. Watch the game, have a look at a handful of players who will be significant pro’s at the next level.\n",

He had 13 catches for WVU last weekend and three touchdowns.

            "This is what a Seahawks receiver looks like after catching a football\n",
            "Some interesting numbers fromAdvanced NFL Stats…\n",
            "– Sidney Rice, earning $8.2m in 2012, has been targeted 15 times in three games. That’s good enough for 58th in NFL receivers, behind Andrew Hawkins, Michael Jenkins and Dexter McCluster. Rice has caught eight of those passes, 40% of which are considered downfield attempts.\n",
            "– Golden Tate is 7oth on the list with 11 targets but missed the opening game against Arizona. 55% of his targets have been downfield throws, second highest in the NFL.\n",
            "– Braylon Edwards has nine targets with five catches. Not a single one of those targets was considered a downfield throw.\n",
            "– Only two tight ends have seen less targets than Zach Miller and Anthony McCoy (both thrown at eight times). In comparison, Jeff Cumberland of the New York Jets has 15 targets.\n",
            "– Russell Wilson has attempted 75 passes, less than every active quarterback in the NFL not named Kevin Kolb or John Skelton. The two Arizona quarterbacks combined have thrown nine more passes than Wilson.\n",
            "– Only one running back has rushed more times than Marshawn Lynch – Houston Adrian Foster. Lynch (72 carries) and Foster (79 carries) are well clear of the chasing pack. Third most active running back – Doug Martin – has 63 carries. Maurice Jones-Drew is fourth with 59 carries.\n",
            "Conclusion: How can we judge if this quarterback and group of receivers are good enough if the passing game is taking such an exaggerated back seat to the running game?\n",
            "I ask this question only because people are either a.) saying Seattle’s greatest need is at receiver and b.) that it’s time for Matt Flynn to start at quarterback. I’ve made the point about receivers myself, but I’m starting to question it. How can we come to that conclusion on such little evidence? Likewise, I’m not sure what you expect to see from Flynn in such an unbalanced offense?\n",
            "Let’s start with the receivers.\n",
            "In 2009 Sidney Rice was 4th in the NFL for receiving yards and yards per game. Only Andre Johnson, Wes Welker and Miles Austin were ranked higher. Sure, the Vikings had the good version of Brett Favre that year. But Rice, when healthy, showed he can be a truly effective NFL receiver. He was a big-play threat too, with only Vincent Jackson and Robert Meachem earning a higher yards per target average. Nobody has ever questioned Rice’s quality, just his ability to stay healthy. Considering he’ll earn $9.7m in both 2013 and 2014, the team will need to feel he’s having a big enough impact to justify that salary. When he signed the deal, Pete Carroll and/or John Schneider clearly felt he could be a defining piece of the offense.\n",
            "Zach Miller’s cap hit in 2012 is $7m and it’ll rise to a humongous $11m in 2013. By the end of the 2012 season Miller will have cost the Seahawks $10m. Another way of looking at it is $1m per three catches and zero touchdowns. He’s played 18 games, most of which he’s acted as a third offensive tackle. Before he moved to Seattle, he was Oakland’s top receiver by some distance in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Again, when he signed the deal, Pete Carroll and/or John Schneider clearly felt he could be a defining piece of the offense.\n",
            "Golden Tate has cost Seattle just $2.06m in salary to date, with the final year of his rookie contract worth $880k in 2013. He also cost the Seahawks an important second round pick in the 2010 draft – Carroll and Schneider’s first with the team. Interesting fact – had the Seahawks not traded for Charlie Whitehurst, they would’ve had the opportunity to draft Rob Gronkowski, Jimmy Graham or Aaron Hernandez. Even with the Whitehurst trade, they had a shot at Graham and Hernandez. Tate has so far produced five career touchdowns for the Seahawks, 13 less than Graham and Hernandez combined for in 2011 alone. Not that anyone expected Tate to produce similar numbers, but people perhaps expected more than they’ve seen so far. After all, he won the Biletnikoff Award at Notre Dame as the nations top college receiver and accumulated 25 receiving touchdowns in 2008 & 2009. The team lacked playmakers in 2010 and Seattle’s front office clearly believed Tate could change that.\n",
            "The point I’m getting at here is, these guys have proven production. In the case of Rice and Miller, it’s proven NFL production. Throw in the promise of Doug Baldwin and Anthony McCoy and this should be a group that you feel comfortable with. Sure, there isn’t the superstar high draft pick who legitimises a unit by reputation alone. Yet there should be enough talent to at least form the basis of a decent passing offense. This isn’t the Cleveland Browns where finding legitimate receivers is beyond a crucial need. It’s just in Seattle, these guys aren’t getting a chance to really show what they can do.\n",
            "I would argue it’s the same situation at quarterback. Robert Griffin III (+14), Ryan Tannehill (+27), Brandon Weeden (+40) and Andrew Luck (+47) all have more passing attempts than fellow rookie Russell Wilson. Pete Carroll has admitted he’s trying to limit turnovers at the moment and I believe him when he says it’d be the same situation for Matt Flynn. It’s not an individual issue at the quarterback position – it’s a scheme decision. It’s worth noting that Seattle has a better record than Griffin’s Redskins, Tannehill’s Dolphins, Weeden’s Browns and Luck’s Colts. Tannehill, Weeden and Luck have combined for 14 interceptions in three games. Griffin III and Wilson – the two quarterbacks with much less passing attempts – have combined for just two interceptions. Coincidence? Or smart coaching?\n",
            "The team wants to run the ball and limit turnovers – there’s no secret there. They are very happy right now to play field position, great defense and hope for one or two big plays to compliment the run game. If the defense can hold a powerhouse offense like Green Bay to twelve points and a decent Cowboys outfit to seven, it might not be the worst plan in the world at home. Yet when Wilson has been challenged he’s looked very sharp. For all the little errors we’ve seen (to be expected from a rookie) we’ve also seen three glorious looking touchdown passes to Rice (Arizona), McCoy (Dallas) and Tate (Green Bay – and not THAT touchdown pass).\n",
            "We look at the list of eligible 2013 receivers and wonder whether a guy like Justin Hunter, Cordarrelle Patterson or Keenan Allen could become a #1 target for Wilson – but what’s the point in making that investment if the team is throwing 15 passes at a guy earning $8.2m this year? We look at guys like Robert Woods and Tavon Austin and wonder if they could be the teams answer to Wes Welker or Percy Harvin, but are they going to have an impact if you’re not going to put the ball in their hands?\n",
            "Perhaps a time will come in the future when they feel confident to allow Wilson to let it rip? Maybe that day will come soon, but this is a regime that has consistently delivered bad numbers at the quarterback position. In 2010 Matt Hasselbeck was 21st for passing yards but delivered an ugly looking 12-17 touchdown-to-interception ratio. His QB rating was only higher than the bad version of Brett Favre, Derek Anderson and Jimmy Clausen. In 2011 Tarvaris Jackson had just 14 touchdowns – as many as Colt McCoy and twelve less than Mark Sanchez. He had a QB rating worse than Kevin Kolb. Ryan Fitzpatrick had over 700 more passing yards than Jackson and more touchdowns, but he also turned it over many more times. More than anything, they wanted Jackson to secure the football – something Hasselbeck struggled to do in 2010.\n",
            "Now Russell Wilson is near the bottom of the same lists. There are some positives because he’s not turning it over, but he’s also showing numbers that belittle all the pre-season hype that built up around the NFL – not just in Seattle. With good reason too – he was superb. It’s a bit like leaving a great car in the garage and then patting yourself on the back because it looks brand new. On the one hand, you have a perfectly unblemished motor vehicle. That’s cool. You’re not lying when you boast about it. But nobody ever sees you driving the thing, so people wonder ‘what’s the point’?\n",
            "The whole situation is being masked by a 2-1 record right now and rightly fans should be satisfied with that. Maybe the Seahawks go into St. Louis and Carolina and out fight their opponents before returning to Seattle with a fantastic 4-1 record? Who the heck is going to complain then if Russell Wilson throws barely over 100 yards in each game?\n",
            "Then there’s the other side of the coin. What if the Seahawks face a situation like the Arizona game? A closely fought contest on the road ending in defeat because when the game was on the line, they couldn’t throw the ball into the end zone? This could become more of an issue very quickly. In fact, had Seattle not been awarded a favorable decision on Monday, it would probably be the big talking point in the local media this week and not ‘that catch’.\n",
            "An unbalanced offense is easy to accept while the team is winning. If that continues, nobody will question anything. Go ‘Hawks! But a risk-free strategy still carries an element of risk. I think back to Rice in 2009, or Tate at Notre Dame, or Wilson in pre-season and wonder… can we turn this on like a tap when needed? Are we making the most of some talented skill players? And can we properly judge them in this current form of a Seahawks offense? Right now I’m not sure how we can judge this quarterback or group of receivers. They’re still in the original packaging.\n",
            "2013 could end up being ‘year of the defensive tackle’. Jonathan Jenkins (Georgia), Star Lotulelei (Utah), Sylvester Williams (North Carolina), Jonathan Hankins (Ohio State) and Kawann Short (Purdue) all look good enough to carry first round grades. Jesse Williams (Alabama) and Bennie Logan (LSU) could also get into the mix. And as the tape proves below, it’s time to put Missouri’s Sheldon Richardson on the list.\n",
            "He’s smaller than some of the guys listed above. Jenkins is a pure nose tackle with superb athleticism for his size, while Williams and Hankins are both capable of playing the nose or acting as a pass rusher. Short and Lotulelei are more orthodox three-techniques and Richardson – at 6-2 and 290lbs – falls into that category. He’s got a bit of the Nick Fairley’s about him in terms of size/athleticism and he’s just as capable as a pass rusher. Perhaps the best example of what an athlete he is are the number of snaps he takes in coverage. Not many defensive tackles drop back, even to monitor screens and underneath routes.\n",
            "There are some concerns – he’s a JUCO transfer with some reported baggage. He missed spring training this year through injury and teams will need to check out his shoulder as a consequence. He does have a quicker first step than any of the names above and perhaps his most impressive feature is his ability to finish. He’ll gain the advantage with initial burst, but he shifts up the gears to create pressure and execute. He’s very active and doesn’t give up on plays where he’s not directly involved. Richardson appears to do a decent job against the run although he’s more effective rushing the passer. Overall he has an impressive skill set for the three technique position.\n",
            "The Seahawks could still use further interior help particularly in the form of a legit pass rusher alongside Brandon Mebane. However, as we’ve seen in the three games so far the teams greatest needs are on offense. Even so this is an area to keep an eye on with so many potential first round picks next April.\n",

            "\n",

            "NFL fans should be embarrassed by what happened tonight. Sure, the Seahawks will take the win. Seattle is now 2-1 against the odds and with a bit of extra luck against a red-hot Arizona team they’d be unbeaten. The fact still remains – nobody can watch that replay and say the final play of the game tonight was anything but an interception. The league is a laughing stock this evening. That’s not taking anything away from the Seahawks who have endured a fair share of misfortune over the years, but they caught a break tonight.\n",
            "It wasn’t just the final play either. The Packers’ touchdown drive was extended by a farcical pass interference call against the Seahawks. Likewise, Seattle’s penultimate drive benefited from an equally stupid flag. An ugly, messy, difficult game got the ending it deserved.\n",
            "This is a Seahawks blog though and not an officiating blog, so let’s look at the team. The ending kind of masks a big issue facing the Seahawks. They clearly possess one of the league’s best defenses – it could even be #1 in the NFL. But they also possess one of the worst offenses and that has to be a big concern. It’s not about individuals either, it’s about a severe lack of balance.\n",
            "The Green Bay Packers failed to score a point in the first half as Seattle sacked Aaron Rodgers eight times and shut down both the pass and the run. It was a massacre, like a home game against the Rams over the last few years. Completely one sided. Most other weeks it’d be the precursor to a comfortable and maybe even emphatic victory. But the Seahawks offense wasn’t playing ball.\n",

            "\n",
            "At half time the Packers planned to slow down the pass rush by running the ball up the gut. Once they’d established the run, it afforded Rodgers more time and he got things moving. Throw in two no-huddle drives and momentum had shifted. The Seahawks needed to respond. It became a game where the Seahawks needed to keep up. They didn’t just fail, they failed in a big way.\n",
            "I’m still trying to work out the play calling. Even with a bigger lead than 7-0, you can’t expect to beat the Packers by being ultra conservative. We know the Seahawks want to run the ball and make that the identity of the team. That’s fine,but you still need balance. Russell Wilson barely threw double digit passes going into the final quarter. You can’t do that against the Green Bay Packers with a slender lead. You can’t do that against most teams. Not unless your running back is on the path to a 200-yard game which he wasn’t. The Seahawks are essentially playing without a passing game at the moment. At best it’s a token gesture.\n",
            "Do they not trust Russell Wilson as a rookie quarterback? Is it merely a misguided game plan? Whatever it is, they need to take a long look at what they’re doing on offense and try to establish a passing game of some form. Next time there won’t be a favorable refereeing decision to bail the team out. The game plan in the second half was almost as difficult to stomach as the replacement officials.\n",
            "We try to look at needs on this blog because the people who visit want to talk about the draft and the future of the team. Seattle’s greatest need right now is to review the offense. By all means keep the run game at the heart of what you want to do – Marshawn Lynch had another great game today. But you have to be prepared to mix it up a bit, get creative, trust Russell Wilson and the playmakers on the team. How can we criticise the quarterback when he isn’t throwing the ball? How can we criticise the receivers when they aren’t involved? Why bother paying Sidney Rice and Zach Miller $13m this year if you’re not going to use them? Or Golden Tate… or Anthony McCoy…\n",
            "And let’s not kid ourselves this isn’t a rare one off stumble. The offense stuttered mightily against Arizona and was poor in the first half against Dallas. The Cowboys were beaten into submission in the second half last week and they duly waved the white flag – but that won’t happen every week especially against the top teams. This is one of the most unbalanced offenses in the NFL, too heavily weighted towards the run. Time to take the training wheels off the passing game and use it.\n",
            "This game will always be remembered for the referee’s. The most important thing Seattle will get out of it other than a notch in the win column, is to have a serious look at the offense before next Sunday. They need to if they’re going to max out their potential this season.\n",
            "And Roger Goodell and the NFL owners need to sort their own mess out long before Sunday.\n",

Suddenly a few pundits wonder whether Notre Dame ‘are for real’ (they have no quarterback). Are Florida State good enough to mount a challenge? Every year these teams emerge, only to fall away. The question I always ask is – can these teams realistically take on Alabama? And the answer is usually no. In fact there’s probably only two teams I think are capable of that – SEC rival LSU and Oregon in the PAC-12. Even then Oregon might be a stretch given their inexperience at certain key positions, but they have enough speed and talent to make up for that.\n",
            "So why are Alabama so consistently great? After all, they’ve seen big-time NFL stars come and go. This is the first year in a long time they haven’t featured a pending first round player at the skill positions. They lost a host of top-end defensive talent to the draft last April. Yet every year they come back for more.\n",
            "The simple answer is they are the best coached team in college football. Nick Saban – love him or hate him – is the best in the business. They are organised, disciplined, committed and playing for each other. Saban constantly churns out elite defensive backs and a brilliant running game. He recruits in such a way that players are desperate to come and play for him. Winning helps, too.\n",
            "This year they have a fine offensive line filled with experienced talent such as Barrett Jones and Chance Warmack. They have enough defensive line quality to create pressure and dominate up front. There’s also one other reason they’re doing so well and it’s about time this guy got some credit.\n",
            "Quarterback A.J. McCarron isn’t going to be a top draft choice. Saban has found production from a string of solid, hard working quarterbacks who act as game managers and facilitate the run. John Parker Wilson and Greg McElroy weren’t very exciting to watch and lacked the physical tools to become a NFL starter, but it’s no surprise both have stuck in the league as backups. McCarron is a little bit different, a little better physically and a lot more dynamic. He’s still cut from the same cloth – he’s more facilitator than playmaker, but for me he has much more of a chance at playing time at the next level. Even if that isn’t the case – it’s about time he received some credit. He won a national title in his first year as a starter and so far in 2012 he has ten touchdowns and zero interceptions, 63% completions and a couple of blowout wins against Michigan and Arkansas.\n",
            "He’s a junior and eligible for the 2013 draft, but he’s more likely to last the distance at Alabama and potentially record three national title’s. His supporting cast is good enough to do that. I’m not sure why he isn’t getting the credit he deserves – is it the personality, which is certainly more expressive than McElroy or Wilson? He’s still a ‘by the book’ type of guy and certainly on an intangible level teams will grade him highly. On a technical level he has average arm strength, but he goes through his progressions and makes very few mistakes. He’s economical, takes what he’s given and on a good team that can run the ball he’s going to offer some value. I’m not here to argue he’s a future first round pick but it’s time he got a bit more credit. He’s the glue holding Alabama’s excellent offense together and a key reason why the Crimson Tide make teams like Florida State bit-part players for the big game. Keep an eye on this guy.\n",
            "Week four stock up\n",
            "Tavon Autin (WR, West Virginia)\n",
            "Explosive playmaker who recorded 13 catches, three touchdowns and 179 yards against Maryland on Saturday. If missing on Russell Wilson has taught me anything, it’s not to presume anything when a guy doesn’t have prototypical size. Austin is only 5-9 and 174lbs and that limits his stock – he’s not going to win many jump balls, he’ll face a lot more physicality at the next level and he won’t be able to out-run people in the same way. Even so, he’s a big-time playmaker. There’s no reason why teams won’t see a little DeSean Jackson in this guy and a team that needs a spark on offense might consider taking a shot. After all – Wes Welker is only 5-9 and 185lbs. Austin theoretically has more of an X-Factor and can be used in many different ways at the next level. At worst he’s a round two pick.\n",
            "Corey Lemonier (DE, Auburn)\n",
            "Lemonier has been nothing short of sensational so far this year. Like Austin, he’s not exactly a prototype at 6-4 and 246lbs. However, he has extreme speed off the edge and a knack of just making plays. He’s edgy and intense and the heart of the Tigers defense. He saved his best game so far for LSU and ended up with two sacks and numerous other splash plays. He has five total sacks for the year and appears set to give Jarvis Jones a run for his money as the SEC’s top pass rusher. Lemonier isn’t going to fit every scheme and 3-4 teams will have to weigh up whether he fits at OLB. He looks like a good fit at the LEO if the Seahawks wanted to make back-to-back first round picks at defensive end. The best thing is you feel he can get even better.\n",
            "Justin Hunter (WR, Tennessee)\n",
            "He was on the sliders list last week, but this weekend could end up being a defining moment for Hunter.Cordarrelle Patterson was partly responsible for a pick-six in the first quarter against Akron, and Tyler Bray seemed to avoid him for the rest of the half. Step forward Justin Hunter, who at times has played second fiddle to Patterson in the Vols passing game in 2012. He looked sharp in an eight-catch 115 yard performancethat included a touchdown. If Bray is going to zone in on Hunter the rest of the way – and if both players can stay healthy – this can only be good for the receivers’ stock. He has the potential to be the top wide-out taken next April.\n",
            "Week four stock down\n",
            "Montee Ball (RB, Wisconsin)\n",
            "It was a big surprise to see Ball return to Wisconsin this year, undoubtedly with the view of making up for last year’s gut-wrenching Rose Bowl defeat. The thing is – he’s a running back with tread on the tires. The chances of the Badgers surviving the departure of Russell Wilson were slim and they’re in the middle of a down-year. Ball had 33 rushing touchdowns last year but in 2012 has just three in four games. He averaged 6.2 yards per carry in 2010 and 2011, but has started this season averaging 3.9 yards per carry. As of today he has 661 college carries, which is already over 100 more than Trent Richardson had at Alabama. And to make matters worse, he picked up a head injury on Saturday and lost his first career fumble. I like Ball, but returning for a fourth year at Wisconsin is hurting his stock.\n",
            "Matt Barkley (QB, USC)\n",
            "Barkley ended the 2011 season with real momentum and the critics should go back and watch his performance vs Oregon before jumping on the negativity bandwagon. However, he hasn’t started this season particularly well. Against Syracuse he looked off the pace despite scoring six touchdowns and things got worse against Stanford and California. He has five interceptions already compared to seven for the entire season last year. Losing Matt Kalil to the draft and Khaled Holmes to injury hasn’t helped, but Barkley needs to prove he can excel without an ideal environment. If he’s drafted early next April, he cannot expect to immediately play in a fluid offense with a great offensive line. And while he’s undoubtedly talented, I just wonder if he’s destined to be a top-20 pick instead of the #1 pick.\n",
            "Barkevious Mingo (DE, LSU)\n",
            "At a generously listed 6-5 and 240lbs, Mingo relies on speed off the edge. He came into the year touted as a possible top-ten pick despite his size, but so far in 2012 he has zero sacks. That’s not the be-all and end-all, but he’s not really had much impact either. Consider that LSU has so far come up against the ‘might’ of North Texas, an over-matched Washington and struggling Auburn. Teams are zoning in on Mingo and he’s being taken out of games. This is helping Sam Montgomery, who is looking a lot sharper with less attention after a slow start to the year himself. If Mingo is going to live up to expectations he needs to start having more of an impact. Time is on his side.\n",
            "Tyler Wilson game tape vs Rutgers\n",
            "Arkansas’ struggles continued at the weekend and Wilson’s ‘quitters’ speech from last week failed to spark a response. He ended the day with three touchdowns, but also two interceptions. He didn’t get much help in this one from his receivers. Keep an eye on Cobi Hamilton, who had over 300 yards receiving and could be a second or third round pick.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Credit where it’s due to E.J. Manuel. He put in probably the best performance of his career to inspire Florida State to a big win over Clemson and the Seminoles are now in pole position to win the ACC. However, I still have no confidence in Manuel as a pro prospect. He has all the physical tools you want and certainly he looks the part. In this game he abused a sluggish Clemson defense with some clinical passes – but against a tougher defense the athleticism and arm strength won’t be enough. In the NFL he’s going to need to make quick decisions at the line, he’s going to need to diagnose confusing coverage situations and he’s going to need to progress through reads. He does none of this at the moment and when challenged, often makes poor decisions. He faced no pressure against Clemson and it afforded him the chance to make plays. There will be tougher tests to come for Manuel and he’ll show why, unfortunately, he’s always going to be more of an athlete than a quarterback.\n",
            "For Clemson, DeAndre Hopkins had a fast start – catching a 60 yard bomb from Tajh Boyd on the opening possession. He got deep, did well to locate the football and win it competing against the defensive back. Hopkins ended with five catches for 88 yards. Andre Ellington will have a role in the NFL too – he only had 55 yards from 14 carries but he added a spectacular touchdown reception from a double pass – breaking off a 52-yard run. He had 4 total catches for 87 yards. Bjoern Werner didn’t have much of an impact as a pass rusher for Florida State but he did make one key open field tackle and he also recorded a pass deflection. This is the first time in 2012 Werner hasn’t recorded a sack. Clemson’s up-tempo quick-hitting offense didn’t really allow much of a pass rush.\n",
            "We published tape of Manti Te’o vs Michigan State yesterday, but the Notre Dame linebacker was even better against Michigan yesterday. He had two interceptions and a forced fumble in a 13-6 victory. Luke Kuechly was the 9thoverall pick this year because of athleticism, intangibles and the way he churned out 100’s of tackles in his college career. Kuechly was never a big playmaker though, rarely impacting games for his team. Te’o isn’t the same kind of athlete, but he has more of an X-factor. For me he’s the superior player.\n",
            "Georgia’s Jarvis Jones didn’t play against Florida Atlantic last week, but he returned in a 48-3 victory over Vanderbilt and recorded yet another sack. In three games he has 4.5 in total and could easily be the first player drafted next April depending on need. Quarterback Aaron Murray continued his possible Heisman charge with 18/24 passing for 250 yards. He had three total touchdowns and zero turnovers. Murray is only around 6-0/6-1 in height and he can be very streaky, but he’s started well this year. If quarterbacks like Tyler Wilson, Tyler Bray and Landry Jones continue to struggle, he could easily develop into a first or second round pick.\n",
            "Whatever Logan Thomas is doing right now, it isn’t working. Virginia Tech rebounded after a bad loss to Pittsburgh last week, beating Bowling Green 37-0. However, Thomas completed just 11/26 passing for 144 yards. He had an interception too – but on a positive note had three total touchdowns and 65 rushing yards. Even so, this appears to be another mixed performance. It’ll be an upset if he declares for 2013 in this form.\n",
            "It was a better day for Geno Smith at West Virginia. This was the Mountaineers toughest game so far and they squeezed through 31-21 against Maryland. Smith ended with 30/43 passing for 338 yards and three touchdowns. However the big star of the day was Tavon Austin – 13 catches, 179 yards and three touchdowns. Austin is a potential first round pick as an explosive playmaker. We’ll take a closer look at him over the next few days but he has a little DeSean Jackson and Percy Harvin to his game. You can see Smith’s tape from the game at the top of this article. Obviously this also includes Austin’s 13 catches. Take a look, because as discussed we’ll come back to this guy later in the week.\n",
            "The honeymoon period is over for Jim Mora – and to some extent for talented running back Jonathan Franklin. After exploding into the new season, he managed just 45 yards from 12 carries against Oregon State as UCLA lost 27-20. Tight end Joseph Fauria had two catches for 20 yards. I’ll watch the tape of this one later in the week.\n",
            "Marcus Lattimore had his most productive day since returning from injury. The South Carolina running back had 85 yards from 21 carries with two touchdowns against Missouri – but he also added 60 yards from seven receptions. If he can keep building momentum on an unbeaten team, his stock will rise. The Gamecocks won comfortably 31-10.\n",
            "Somehow, Washington State lost 35-34 to Colorado. Marquess Wilson had another big night, registering five catches for 99 yards and two touchdowns. It’ll be no consolation for Mike Leach. Colorado were 17 down with 7:22 to play and winless until this week.\n",
            "Underrated UNC defensive tackle Sylvester Williams had another sack as the Tar Heels defeated East Carolina 27-6. Williams has 3.5 sacks in four games. He’s a strong interior presence against the run but he can penetrate and rush the passer. He’s scheme diverse and should be an early pick next April.\n",
            "Tennessee receiver Cordarrelle Patterson maybe came down to earth a bit this weekend. He had only two receptions for 20 yards and two rushes for 12 yards in a 47-26 win over Akron. He was also partly responsible for a pick six early in the game – losing position and not being physical enough to shield the ball. That could be the reason he failed to record any stats in the first half, with Bray zoning in on other targets. Patterson is still raw and needs to rebound in the next game. It was a better day for Justin Hunter with eight catches for 115 yards and a touchdown. Tyler Bray finished with 27/43 passing, 401 yards and four touchdowns. It’ll be interesting to see if Bray favours Hunter over Patterson going forward. The reverse was true in previous weeks.\n",
            "Arkansas is a mess. A complete shambles. Poorly coached, the Bobby Petrino scandal has hit them harder than anyone could expect. They were beaten again yesterday 35-26 by a superior Rutgers team. Tyler Wilson’s stock is sinking. He completed 20/39 passing for 419 yards and three scores, but he also had two interceptions. But perhaps most damaging is the way his team failed to respond to the ‘quitters’ speech last week. If you’re going to call out your teammates, it has to have an impact. On a more positive note, Cobi Hamilton had 10 catches for an incredible 303 receiving yards and three touchdowns. It was another long day for Knile Davis however, who had just 17 yards from ten carries.\n",
            "Matt Barkley is going through a poorly timed slump. Against California he was OK, but had another two interceptions to go along with two scores, 192 yards and 22/34 passing. USC’s usually functioning offense is a bit off-cue at the moment, largely due to issues on the offensive line. Here’s the thing though – Barkley has to be able to adapt to that. Teams picking early next year will need to feel confident that he can operate in not-ideal circumstances. He’s too technically talented to drop too far, but it’s this kind of scenario that makes him a top-10 pick rather than the top-1 pick. He doesn’t have the physical tools to carry a team that isn’t performing. And this is what we’ve always said about Barkley’s stock – some teams will love his poise, accuracy and field intelligence. Others will wonder whether he’s physically gifted enough to warrant a very high pick. Robert Woods only had 5 catches for the day for 30 yards.\n",
            "Landry Jones is still playing like Landry Jones. Oklahoma lost at home to Kansas State yesterday 24-19, with Jones going 28/43 for 298 yards, one touchdown and one interception. However, we’re seeing the same old issues with pressure, the same inability to react when the play breaks down, zero inspiration and awareness. At one point Jones rolled out of the pocket and locked onto a receiver downfield, took an age and was sacked – forcing a fumble which was returned for a short touchdown. Its plays like that he should be avoiding at this stage in his career. He started last season as a mid-round talent and 12 months on, things aren’t getting any better.\n",
            "I’m going to watch the LSU/Auburn tape later this week, but I did notice that through four weeks Barkevious Mingo is sackless. That has to be some concern for a speed pass-rush specialist whose only opposition so far has been North Texas (blowout), Washington (blowout), Idaho (blowout) and Auburn (close victory). Sam Montgomery, in comparison, has two sacks. Corey Lemonier on the other hand is going from strength to strength. I did watch a bit of the Auburn game last night and he was flying around making plays. He had two sacks on the night – now five for the season against tough opponents like LSU, Clemson and Mississippi State. His stock is flying up the boards. He might be the best pure pass rusher eligible for 2013 after Jarvis Jones. He’s not a big defensive end and will either transition to a 3-4 OLB or need to play in a system that favours speed vs prototypical size (eg Seattle). Yet Lemonier is one of the fastest risers in college football and is creating a big impression.\n",

A first down or two could have bled the clock and forced New York into a tough spot with the time dwindling and just one remaining timeout.

            "BOSTON (CBS) -- Prepare for at least one full week of Patriots panic in New England.\n",
            "In this case, it just may be warranted, as the New England defense played extremely poorly for much of the afternoon on Sunday at Gillette Stadium. However, thanks to a couple of huge forced turnovers around the goal line, the defense played well enough --barely-- to walk away with a 37-31 victory.\n",
            "In the win, there were plenty of positives and negatives, so let's get into the Four Ups and Four Downs from the New England win.\n",
            "Four Ups\n",
            "Tom Brady\n",
            "While the awful defensive showing will dominate most of the discussion this week, don't forget Tom Brady's play. It wasn't the greatest performance of his career, but he led an offense that came close to putting together a perfect showing for essentially three full quarters of football. Excluding a two-play drive before halftime, the Patriots' first seven drives ended like this: field goal, touchdown, touchdown, touchdown, punt, touchdown, field goal. And as it turned out, the Patriots ended up needing every single one of their 37 points.\n",
            "Brady himself went 23-for-38 for 237 yards and a pair of touchdowns, but most importantly he threw zero interceptions. In this game, with the New England defense playing so poorly, any turnover would have been absolutely crushing. Brady limited his mistakes, knew when to throw the ball away, and took just one sack despite facing a decent amount of pressure for much of the game.\n",
            "It was the type of Brady performance that tends to get taken for granted at times in New England. I'd argue that this week, it shouldn't.\n",
            "Stephen Gostkowski\n",
            "Another performance that should not get overlooked is that of Stephen Gostkowski. Often, if a kicker isn't out there making a last-second field goal, his afternoon can get overlooked, but had Gostkowski not had the day he had, this very well could have been a loss for New England.\n",
            "He was a perfect 3-for-3 on field goal attempts, including a 43-yarder to give the Pats a 3-0 lead and later a 48-yarder to give the Patriots a two-possession lead in the fourth quarter. Had he missed that 48-yarder, the Bills would have taken over near midfield trailing by just a touchdown. Considering the Bills drove 93 yards on the drive that followed that kick, it's very likely the game would have been tied at some point in the fourth quarter. Thanks to Gostkowski, that never happened.\n",
            "And while his third kick may have been just a chip shot, it nevertheless gave the Patriots a much-needed cushion, thereby forcing the Bills to play for a touchdown rather than a field goal.\n",
            "Danny Woodhead\n",
            "\"Little\" Danny Woodhead, as he's unofficially known to seemingly every announcer in the world, had just two touchdowns on the season, but he found the end zone twice on Sunday for the first time in his career.\n",
            "His only carry was a big one, as he exploded through a hole for a 15-yard touchdown run.\n",
            "Averaging 2.4 receptions for 25 yards per game this season, Woodhead stepped up in Aaron Hernandez's absence with four catches for 46 yards and a touchdown. The scoring play was a beautiful one, as he burned his man (linebacker Nick Barnett) and juked Jarius Byrd near the 3-yard line before diving across the goal line for the score.\n",
            "It was the type of extra effort that defines Woodhead as an NFL player, and it was a major reason why the Patriots came out on top in this one.\n",
            "Stevan Ridley\n",
            "It wasn'tquitethe 106-yard, two-touchdown performance that Ridley had earlier in the year against Buffalo, but it was close. The second-year running back looked awfully refreshed coming off the bye week, as he finished with 98 rushing yards and a score for the home team.\n",
            "He played a major role in the Patriots sustaining long scoring drives, which was crucial considering the Bills' offense could drive the ball at will.\n",
            "Four Downs\n",
            "\"Everything\"\n",
            "It's a common saying from Bill Belichick: We have to play better and we have to coach better. Nothing better sums up this game than that saying right there.\n",
            "Matt Patricia watched all afternoon as rookie Alfonzo Dennard chased Stevie Johnson in vain, to the effect of Johnson catching six passes for 86 yards. Yet no noticeable changes were made to the defensive assignments. For that matter, the entire middle of the field was wide open for Ryan Fitzpatrick all day long, and he probably hasn't thrown two easier touchdown passes since he was facing Brown University back in '03.\n",
            "You can pick on individual performances all you want, and that's fair, but the Patriots' defensive woes can't be attributed to any one person, be it a player or a coach. There's a lot of work to be done if this team wants to really compete for a championship. Getting 148 penalty yards and three somewhat gift-wrapped turnovers and still only beating the Bills by six points just isn't going to cut it.\n",
            "Mental Mistakes\n",
            "The Patriots' defense didn't need to give the Buffalo offense any extra yards, yet three mental mistakes proved costly.\n",
            "Dennard took a dive at Fitzpatrick's legs after the quarterback scrambled out of bounds, giving the Bills a free 15 yards and getting them to the edge of the red zone. Three plays later, Fitzpatrick connected with Scott Chandler for a touchdown to cut the Patriots' lead in half just before halftime.\n",
            "Brandon Spikes made the next mental mistake, going helmet-to-facemask on Fitzpatrick on a second-down incompletion early in the fourth quarter. Instead of a third-and-8 from their own 47, the Bills had a first-and-10 from the New England 38. While the Patriots did force a turnover at the goal line, the offense couldn't do anything with that field position and punted the ball right back to the Bills, who scored a touchdown on the ensuing drive.\n",
            "But on the first play of that ensuing drive, it was Jerod Mayo with the unnecessary late hit out of bounds on C.J. Spiller. The penalty took the Bills from the Pats' 31-yard line to the 16-yard line, and sure enough the Bills were in the end zone three plays later.\n",
            "The defense is simply not talented enough to be making these types of errors, and it nearly cost them a win on Sunday.\n",
            "And while Buffalo had an absurdly high number of penalties, the Patriots' seven penalties for 73 yards were far too many. Ridley's false start on second-and-goal from the 4-yard line was chief among them, as it may have turned a touchdown drive into a field goal drive.\n",
            "Drops\n",
            "Seven points turned into three points on the Patriots' opening drive due to Wes Welker's dropping a surefire touchdown. On the same drive, Deion Branch dropped a would-be first down when he let a pass from Brady bounce off his stomach. That ball very well should have been picked off, but Branch was alert enough to rip the ball out of the defensive back's hands.\n",
            "Julian Edelman later let a long bomb from Brady sail through his arms, though he was bailed out by a penalty on Buffalo away from the play. Later, with the Patriots trying to drive from their own 1-yard line, Welker had another big drip over the middle on what should have moved the chains. Instead, the Patriots were forced to punt two plays later, and the Bills scored on the ensuing drive to cut the lead to just a field goal in the fourth quarter.\n",
            "If Welker can squeeze those passes, this game very well could have looked a lot different than it did. Of course, Welker's six catches for 74 yards shouldn't be dismissed, but his drops provide an example of the Patriots' inner drive to always improve and always believe they can be better.\n",
            "Third-down defense\n",
            "For all the Patriots' defensive faults, one or two more stops on third (or fourth) down would have made a big impact. The Bills were able to convert seven of their 11 third-down attempts, and they also went 1-for-1 on fourth-down conversions. This inability for the defense to get off the field was the biggest culprit for the Patriots' being unable to build an insurmountable lead and ultimately losing the time of possession battle by nearly eight minutes.\n",
            "As was mentioned with the blaming of \"Everything\" earlier, this issue can't be pinned on any one person, but it's going to be rather difficult to beat good teams and will be darn near impossible to win playoff games if this defense can't make more plays, force punts, and keep the ball in Brady's hands.\n",

Can’t say I blame him.He has a nice mix of young skill talent and veteran gritand his dollar cost averaging for his offensive line could pay off.\n",
            "Although his defense has some clear weaknesses, he also has talented players that should do a good job of playing aggressive football when Stuart’s team has a lead. If this team gets behind early it could be problematic, but I can see how this offense is set up for this team to go 10-6, even in a tough division.\n",
            "Learn more about Stuart’s team below as the writer atFootballguys.com,Pro Football Reference, and (his new blog)Football Perspectiveprovides an engaging take on the RSP Writers Project.\n",
            "Describe your offensive system.\n",
            "The offense will be a hybrid of what the Manning Colts did combined with some elements from the offenses in New England, Green Bay and New Orleans.  The base set would be three wide receivers with a tight end – Graham and Cruz on the inside, Boldin and Smith on the outside – and Hunter in the backfield.\n",
            "Delanie Walker will get his fair share of playing time, as Manning likes the two-tight end sets and we won’t keep Graham in to block all that often.   With Walker helping to give Manning extra time, Manning will be able to isolate Cruz, Graham or Smith on any given play.  In running situations, we can bring in Vladimir Ducasse as a sixth lineman or Matt Mulligan.\n",
            "Blocking Schemes, Bread and Butter Plays, and Pivotal Players in the Scheme:\n",
            "The offense runs through Peyton Manning and he is the offense.  Everyone else is replaceable, but Manning will be the quarterback and de facto offensive coordinator.  For the long-term, whichever quarterback that replaces Manning will be pretty lucky to have Jimmy Graham and Victor Cruz to throw to.  They’re two of the most difficult players to cover in the NFL.\n",
            "Coordinators and Coaches:\n",
            "The goal is to recreate the elite passing offenses that we’ve seen in Indianapolis, New England, Green Bay and New Orleans.  In Indianapolis and New England, I’m not so sure there is a coach we can identify as the man behind the success as much as the quarterback.  But I’d love to have Mike McCarthy or Sean Payton or Tom Clements on my coaching staff, and obviously I’d take Belichick no matter what team I had.  Mike Leach would be another great fit, but honestly, having Peyton Manning and Tom Moore is probably all I would need.\n",
            "Describe your defensive system.\n",
            "I envision the 4-3 defense playing a blend of the Tampa-2 that Dungy brought to Indianapolis along with the more exotic Baltimore/Ryan scheme.  The Tampa-2 worked well with the Colts thanks to Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis, and the hope is that Shea McClellin, Aaron Maybin and Vinny Curry can provide a similar level of pass rush.  But the Colts never had the talent in the secondary that this defense has – Eric Berry, Morris Claiborne, Ike Taylor, Ryan Clark and Kyle Wilson – which will enable us to play more man coverage.   In the event that we don’t have an elite pass rusher, we will need to have more creative blitzes, and in that case, we’ll be fortunate to have more talented defenders in the secondary.  I consider Wilson a starter as a nickel corner, as the defense will probably play nickel more than anything else.\n",
            "Claiborne and Berry are the anchors of the secondary, although the unit couldn’t excel if any of the five members of the secondary didn’t possess strong pass coverage skills.  Phil Taylor is the key to the front seven; when healthy, he’ll make the job easier for every other defensive linemen, who will keep our linebackers free to make plays.\n",
            "Defensive Coordinators and Coaches:\n",
            "Rex Ryan or Rob Ryan would both be good fits.  I’d love to bring back Tony Dungy just because I think he’s an excellent defensive mind.  Ditto Mike Tomlin.\n",
            "Where do you believe your offense is vulnerable in terms of system and personnel and what specifically have you done to minimize the impact of those vulnerabilities?\n",
            "Obviously the offensive line is less than stellar.  However, what I have done is avoided having any obvious holes on the line.  While none of the starters cost more than $5 million per year, none of them cost less than $4.5 million per year, either.  I believe a balanced offensive line is more important than the individual parts.\n",
            "Offensive linemen are nominally offensive players, of course, but on pass plays, they play defensive roles.  They retreat, and they block, preventing the aggressors from reaching the quarterback.  They’re gatekeepers, and the key to an effective gate is more about the strength of the weakest link than the strongest one.  Defenses will attack my offensive line, but I don’t believe there’s any obvious weakness for opposing defensive coordinators to focus on.  If you have $25 million to spend on your offensive line, the smartest move in my opinion is to evenly distribute that money, and that’s exactly what I did.\n",
            "Where do you believe your defense is vulnerable in terms of system and personnel and what specifically have you done to minimize the impact of those vulnerabilities?\n",
            "The linebackers are the weak spot of the defense, but I anticipate having five or six defensive backs on the field frequently.  The run defense could also be a weak spot, but the thinking is Taylor by himself can really help shut down the running game.  Against run heavy teams, Cody will be playing a significant role, and the hope is that Heyward or “MTV” can develop, too.\n",
            "Who are your stars and why did you invest so much in them?\n",
            "Peyton Manning is the key.  With an elite quarterback and competent weapons, you can just about pencil your team in for the playoffs.  With Jimmy Graham and Victor Cruz, I’ve got one player who ranked in the top three in receptions and one in the top three in receiving yards in 2011.  Those three can form the cornerstone of the offense for the next three-to-five years.\n",
            "On defense, Taylor is there as the man who can support all the run-stopping responsibilities on his massive shoulders.  Eric Berry and Maurice Claiborne are young and dynamic members of the secondary and would help anchor my pass defense.  With an excellent offense, being able to protect the lead and shut down opposing passing attacks is paramount.\n",
            "Name some of your offensive role players who might be role players now, but you believe could develop into much more as a starter or even star in your organization.\n",
            "Between Nate Davis and Colt McCoy, the hope is one of them can replace Manning in a few years.  LaMichael James could be a starter as quickly as 2012.  T.Y. Hilton may take a couple of years to develop, but he could easily become a starter as Boldin is phased out of the offense.\n",
            "Name some of your defensive role players who might be role players now, but you believe could develop into much more as a starter or even star in your organization.\n",
            "On the defensive line, Cameron Heyward has the potential to be an every down starter in this league.  I also think Cody has significant upside as a run-stuffing tackle.  It’s hard to get a read on Aaron Maybin, but he could certainly blossom in an excellent pass rusher, which will make him extremely valuable even if he never starts a game.  In the secondary, I am excited about the prospect of Kyle Wilson as a nickel corner, but he will be a starter within a couple of seasons.\n",
            "Which of your starters or significant situational contributors on your rosters do you believe would be on the roster bubble in 2013?\n",
            "For age reasons, Anquan Boldin and Ike Taylor may not last long.  At the linebacker position, I’ve invested so little in them that any of the starters could lose their job due to poor performance, and would anticipate hitting that position early in the 2013 draft.\n",
            "What was the most difficult part of the selection process for you?\n",
            "I attacked the offense first and then the secondary, leaving little money left for my front seven.  I really wanted to grab Phil Taylor, but it left me extremely low on resources for the rest of my starters.  As a result, finding three linebackers and the other defensive tackle was a struggle.\n",
            "I also couldn’t decide exactly what wide receivers would excel in my Manning-style offense.  Cruz did much of his damage in the slot last year, and I was a little concerned that he would excel as a number one wide receiver on my team.  But the thought of replacing him with a similarly-priced but less explosive player didn’t appeal to me.\n",
            "Based on your roster what type of playing facility would you want as your home stadium (describe the facility as outdoors, indoors, turf, grass, climate)?\n",
            "Like the Saints and Colts, I’d like to play indoors and on turf.  Obviously the Patriots and Packers have managed to create high-flying pass offenses outdoors, but I don’t think that is ideal for my passing offense.  Considering the speed of my defense – including McClellin, Maybin, Claiborne and Berry – I think a dome suits them best, too. And remember, the Packers have won only one home playoff game since 2003.  The Patriots won two home playoff games last year, but weather wasn’t a factor in either game, and New England hadn’t won a home playoff game since ’07 prior to last year.\n",
            "Name three risky personnel selections on offense and explain why (talent, off-field, age, injury, fit, etc.).\n",
            "I’m not sure if Kendall Hunter is a starting every down running back, which is why I invested heavily in backups Pierre Thomas and LaMichael James.\n",
            "Obviously Jonathan Martin is a low-end left tackle, and one could argue that protecting your star quarterback who missed all of last season should have been a priority for this team.\n",
            "I spent $93.5 million on my offense, presumably quite a bit more than the average person.  For that reason, I shouldn’t have too many risky starters, and I don’t think I do.  If forced to make a third pick, I suppose Manning is the choice. Due to age and injury history, it’s risky taking him over spending an extra four million on Brady.\n",
            "Name three risky personnel selections on defense and explain why (see above).\n",
            "By spending only $55.5 million on defense, I should have more risky personnel selections on defense, and you could quibble with any of my front seven picks.  I spent $7 million on Taylor, who is coming off of an injury.  My other three starters on the defensive line are all rookies, which may not jive with an offense that’s been built to win now. McClellin, Crick and Curry look like good picks, but they’re obviously unproven.\n",
            "All three linebackers come with questions.  Hawk has been inconsistent his whole career, and was part of a terrible defense last year.  Hill and McClain played well last year, but are not elite players and do not have long histories of success.\n",
            "Name a few players you really wished to add, but couldn’t find the room due to the restrictions of the salary cap or the fit within your team’s system.\n",
            "I would have liked to have gone with Brady, Brees or Rodgers, but decided to roll the dice with Manning due to salary concerns.  Tyron Smith would have been a great player to add, but I just couldn’t justify so much money at one position on the offensive line.  I started this with the idea of having Darren Sproles, but $6.5 million for a committee running back just wouldn’t work.  On defense, building around Haloti Ngata would have been great, but I was forced to settle for Phil Taylor.  I would have liked to have had at least one elite coverage outside linebacker, but there just wasn’t enough money in the budget for that.\n",
            "Which players on your team would you have added even if they cost more than the listed price?\n",
            "An elite quarterback was necessary for the offense I wanted to run.  I took Manning because he was cheaper than the others, but there was no way I wasn’t going to grab an All-Pro type.   Otherwise I mostly looked for value.  I thought Jimmy Graham and Victor Cruz were good values, but I wanted to make sure I gave my quarterback some elite options.  But in the NFL, almost everyone is replaceable, so I really wouldn’t reach for anyone.\n",
            "How do you think the makeup of your roster and distribution of your resources illustrates where your philosophy breaks with NFL conventional wisdom?\n",
            "NFL conventional wisdom is a funny thing, as I’m not sure if it even exists.  But I suppose if I told people that “offensive lines and defenses are overrated, it’s all about the skill position players” that I would be mocked as a fantasy geek.\n",
            "The truth is, individual players on offensive lines and on defense can be overrated.  As a Jets fan, I watched Darrelle Revis have a magnificent season in 2009, shutting down every wide receiver and help the other ten members on defense.  He was the reason the Jets ranked #1 in nearly every major defensive category that season.  Then, in the AFC Championship Game, Manning torched the rest of the Jets defense, as Pierre Garcon and Austin Collie combined for 18 catches for 274 yards and 2 touchdowns.  If there’s a weak spot on your defense, an elite quarterback will find it.  Even two great corners can be neutralized if you have poor safety play.  So my philosophy is not necessarily to find stars on defense, but to avoid having duds.  For me, it’s not as much about finding players to build around as avoiding to play guys that opposing quarterbacks will target.\n",
            "The same is true on the offensive line. The Jets have three Pro Bowl caliber players, but an awful right tackle made the entire unit mediocre.  Good defenses can scheme to attack your weakness on the line.  One star defensive player or offensive lineman isn’t that valuable, in my opinion.  They’re the classic “whole is greater than the sum of their parts.”\n",
            "On the other hand, one star offensive player, like a quarterback, can be a huge difference maker.  Combined with Graham and Cruz, and I have the foundation for an elite passing offense.  That might break with conventional wisdom, but it’s how I would manage this salary cap.\n",
            "How much of a priority did you place on special teams, considering the restrictions of the salary cap? How would you rate your special teams unit?\n",
            "Almost none.  I took Wallace Wright and James Ihedigbo because they can be good in punt and kick coverage, but also because they simply filled the roster spot.  I wanted good returners, and LaMichael James, T.Y. Hilton and Ted Ginn fit that bill. But individual kickers and punters are pretty meaningless to me in the grand scheme.  Special teams can be important, sure, but the problem is that special teams performances are wildly variant from year to year.  I’d much rather have a good special teams coach and have him figure out the rest.\n",
            "Here’s a quick test: name the kicker, punter, and special teams stars on the ‘60s Packers, ’70s Steelers, ’80s ‘49ers and ‘90s Cowboys.  That’s what I thought.\n",
            "Matt Waldman\n",
            "[…] selections are far less interesting than the reasoning behind the players chosen. You can view the full Q&A session I had with Matt Waldman about my roster, but let me explain two of the philosophies that influenced […]\n",
            "[…] RSP Writers Project: The Sporting News’ Russ Lande, Footballguys’ Chase Stuart, Pro Football Focus’ Sam Monson, and Bleacher Report’s Matt Miller have all unveiled […]\n",
            "Well, this is certainly a team that doesnt lack intrigue. Very interesting. Couple things that definitely stand out here and its definitely unique and has a certain flare to it.1) I’m all for the spend big on offense theory that goes back to Bill Polians model with Peyton Manning and his Colts. It might not be readily apparent at first, but thats basically a trend alot of teams these days are now following these days. The advancements in the game have made it so thats most beneficial to invest and try to generate top players at key offensive positions. Bill Belichick has quitely realized this the past decade and shifted the focus of the team. You see the same thing with the Detroit Lions who are basically replicating the Colts model from the past decade. The Green Bay Packers have really gone full throttle on this, creating a plethora of offensive talent while supplying Rodgers with plenty of attention up front and basically building a defense around a few stars and a bunch of not so stud type players if we’re being polite. The Saints have done this also. In general the trend youll notice now are the teams with the core of supreme offensive talent are the ones who have repeated success and the teams that rely on defense, special teams, running the ball and minimizing their QBs impact need everything to break right(think turnover difference injuries—–San Francisco and the Jets to name a few) tend to be the ones that come and go and dont have lasting success. This is a bit of a generalization; the Steelers will be everybodys quick counter to that and thats fine but the point still stands that if you can have your choice of doing whatever you want to build a team(and your not stuck in a position of trying to change a team thats been a defense oriented unit for so long like a lot of GMs are), then you take the chance to stockpile offensive talent.2) The receiving core is fascinating because the trio of Victor Cruz-Jimmy Graham-Torrey Smith is a deep threat trio, but presents problems vertically in 3 different ways. You have the seam physical monster in Graham whos still learning how to play and will attract rolling coverage everytime he goes up the seam and whos perfectly comfortable being flexed out as a receiver. Hes the jump ball threat people think of when they think of deep threats. Then you have Victor Cruz, the slot demon who can provide vertical threat with supreme acceleration and change of direction ability operating out of option routes from the slot. With him the entire field is a threat and with his route running and ball tracking skills hes about the only slot receiver in the NFL who truly demands bracket coverage(that includes Wes Welker your not bracketing Welker in a traditional sense when all his work is before 15 yards from the line). Then theres Torrey Smith, the burner and the go route specialist, “taking the top off the defense”. He’s limited with what he can do right now and theres no gurantee he fully develops(people just like to assume raw receivers will develop into far more complete players as they get older, doesnt always happen like that at all), but hes the type of player wholl cause every opposing coordinator fear because it takes too much out of your gameplan to consistently double and rotate coverage towards him, itll leave you too vulnerable in other areas and hes the third best option on this team—not the best use of resources, so your essentially forced to give him matchups hes capable of exploiting. He wont always do it but your at this teams mercy. He can be completely rendered for 85% of a game but 1-2 plays with him can turn everything. Your always at his mercy. Theres potentially a fourth deep threat with TY Hilton a good develomental prospect and I think Anquan Boldin could carve a few more years out of his career by being rendered a slot type receiver playing with a QB who can maximize slot receivers(think timing, anticipation, communication, basically what Peyton Manning has strived at his whole career and the type of things Joe Flacco can be a little inconsistent with)3) The decisions Chase has made here with his RBs also I think are the direction RB is heading towards in todays game. Its not necessairly a position of significantly declining importance, its role has just changed. Theyve become spatial players, chesspieces that can be used in a multitude of ways and the key with them is they can attack every part of the field. Thats why running back option routes have been a staple of the league for so long and why teams have really started amplifying the different number of ways to get them the ball. The direction towards the quicker scatbacks also allows them to run out of spread formations(so your not giving away anything about your play call before the snap) and dictate opposing personnel. He has a very solid trio with potential to work with here. Hes got 3 very good slot options, a true burner outside and then these explosive toys that can do a variety of things and attack every part of the field and play in any situation. Any offense with Peyton Manning is going to face alot of subpackages. These are exactly the kind of RBs you want for those situations because these players DEMAND attention by there very nature since they have so much open space and get tend to get the ball significantly more than any receiver.4) Its rather interesting how this defense was built; through corners and a hell of a prospect at safety in Eric Berry. The hope here is that young players can develop to form a pass rush. But its a very very risky appraoch because if McClellin and Curry dont develop(and these arent sure fire top 10 picks so its a very real possibility) then a defense built around a young secondary, no pass rush and what Chase admitted might be a bit shaky of a run defense is going to have problems. I’m not sure pass rush is the area in a 4-3 defense to be banking on unproven risky commodities in. Maybe in your case it might have been the best way to go, but its worth looking at closer.5) Furthermore this is a defense banking on 3 rookies with Caliborne, McClellin and Curry at absoultely crucial positions. And Eric Berry is also a bit of a prospect considering hes only had 16 games in the league. Thats 21.5 committed to 4 prospects at huge positions. And then the highest paid player on the unit Phil Taylor is another prospect who frankly didnt have a particuarly good rookie season which makes it up to 28.5(I’m really surprised with the Taylor selection. To spend 7 on someone who wasnt particulary good as a rookie and wasnt a top 20 pick…..ehhh. If you want a dominant defensive tackle up front there were many other options that are the best case possibility for Phil Taylor at a few dollars more.) If your not gonna spend that much on a defense its generally a good idea to go with young cheap prospects that have potential to be worth much more than there price tag. But the word cheap doesnt apply here with these prospects. Your banking on them to develop to their full potential. Thats always a risky proposition. Maybe the best way to go when you arent going to spend much on that side of the ball(or maybe not I’m not sure its up for debate) but rather risky.6) I raved about hte possibilities on offense earlier but let me throw out one caveat; theres no real X isolation receiver capable of consistently winning on the outside or if you want to really use cliches “being the true no 1 receiver”. We already talked about Torrey Smiths limitations. Jimmy Graham is a tight end, sure he can flex out and play snaps as a receiver, even an X isolated receiver in a 3X1 distirbution, but hes still a tight end whos more on the raw side. Victor Cruz is far and away his best in the slot. He can play outside  but thats not his niche and he isnt someone whos at his best trying to beat one on one coverage outside or being the focus of opposing game plans(he was largely taken away for long stretches in the playoffs once he started getting consistently bracketed). Anquan Boldin is also at his best in the slot. There are tight ends who run better than him; he doesn’t strike me as a guy Id want to ask to win one on one matchups outside. All these receiving optiosn have some limitations and have to be manipulated. Theres no receiver who is comfortable being isolated or really having to win on the outside consistently and against coverages focused at them. Peyton Manning can help camoflauge there weaknesses but only to a point and hes not the long term option at QB.7) I also liked the selections at RBs but i Don’t like the price tag. 11 for 3 RBs, none of whom strike as real feature RBs and who all have limitations. Hunter and James are both still relatively unproven in a way and theres a reason Pierre Thomas has never been a starter and that within teh past year the Saints signed Darren Sproles and traded away a first round pick to move up to get Mark Ingram. Its an expensive investment. There valuable players, but is the spot worth 11 on commodities with real question marks? I’m not sure that might have been the best use of money and if your going to spend 11 on RBs I might be inclined to spend big on one like a McCoy or Ray Rice and use a few dollars left over to get a respectable backup like a javon Ringer, Chris Ivory or Bernard Scott. Just something to think about.8) Last thing and this is the one real question I have. You say this is a team built to win now in your Ike Taylor comment. But look at how many unproven commodities you have at key positions. Your WR group is very young and while theyve all had success, your banking on all of them probably improving. Your LT is a rookie with question marks. Your key cogs on defense are almost all unproven(Taylor, your 2 pass rushers, Claiborne and to a lesser extent Berry). Is that really the direction of a team built to win now? The thing is, if Peyton Manning is your QB, you have to be in win now mode given his recent past and age. Its just that the way the defense is built and other positions like LT, RB and to a lesser extent WR, that this is a rather risky way to approach to win now with. I think the strategy here is value; to get guys that exceed their price tag in a few years, especially on defense. The thing is that few years it might take them. Rookies with Pro Bowl potential usually dont play like pro bowlers there rookie year, if at all. Thats the only real question I have is the direction of the team and the plan long term with Peyton Manning really probably going to be around for 2 and at hte absolute most 3 years. This offense is so dependent on him it needs a good predecessor and I’m not sure Id want to put faith in Colt McCoy to be that guy. All in all though, very interesting, definitely some good ideas put in place and some ideas that I wouldnt have thought of. Well done and a good read for sure.\n",

            "Tom Brady Sr. says Bill Belichick is “the best coach in football,” but one characteristic ultimately led tohis son’s breakup with the longtime Patriots coach.\n",
            "After 20 seasons and six Super Bowls together, Brady left the Patriots for the Buccaneers and won another Super Bowl in his first year with Tampa Bay, while Belichick went 29-38 with the Patriots after Brady’s departure, missing the playoffs in three of four years.\n",
            "“Bill is tough,” Brady Sr.told the Boston Globe. “He runs a military system. It’s a different generation. Bill is a great, great, great coach. But his interpersonal skills are horrible. That’s the bottom line.\n",
            "“How many times has he said — back in ‘15 or ‘16 — that he wanted to win without Tommy? When he went without Tommy, he didn’t know what he was losing. You’re losing more than just a quarterback.\n",
            "“Ego sometimes gets in the way of things. I think it did with Bill. Now, he’s in a situation where he’s gotten crucified for the last few years by everybody and a lot of luster has come off his rose.”\n",
            "Belichickparted ways with Kraft and the Patriotslast month after 24 seasons and now finds himself without a job, having only interviewed with the Falcons, who hired Raheem Morris as their new coach.\n",

            "The owner admitted to Brady’s family on Sept. 10, when Brady returned to Foxborough to be honored after his retirement, that he erred in allowing Brady to leave.\n",
            "“He just said, ‘I made a mistake.’ He told us that back in September,” Brady Sr. said of Kraft. “We don’t all make the right decisions, but he’s made a hell of a lot of good ones over the years. But I know that it galls him that Tommy went elsewhere and won. Not that he won, but that he won after Bill said he was done.”\n",

            "Well, then. Now that almost 48 full hours have passed and all of us have likely caught our breath, we can examine more clearly and coherently then Patriots stirring, improbable, 23-20 win over the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship. The win, which sends the Pats to their seventh Super Bowl and fifth under the magical tandem of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady (the most of any QB/coach combo of all time), was maddening, scintillating, ugly, glorious and completely perplexing, sometimes all at once. The Pats won with defense and physicality and if you had that one down headed into the game, I’ve got some lottery numbers for you to play (I’ll throw in a healthy commission for your trouble), with Brady playing one of his worst games of the season and the team losing three turnovers but somehow getting away with it. Multiple defensive guys had huge days and when you take that, some strong, powerful running by the Law Firm of BenJarvus Green-Ellis, more of the same mental toughness this team has shown all year and at least a spoonful of luck (fear not, we’ll get to the missed, 32-yard field goal, also known as the biggest gag job I’ve ever seen), it all adds up to a trip to the big game 12 days from now in Indianapolis. So with that, let’s get to this week’s report card, all dressed up and ready for the dance.\n",
            "OFFENSE: C+Quarterbacks: CBefore we go any further, let’s get this out of the way: Brady is as tough, if not tougher than any QB in the NFL. On his fourth quarter, one-yard TD plunge, he was upside down in midair when he was blasted in the kidneys and lower back by the helmet and shoulder pads of none other than Ravens all-time linebacker Ray Lewis. And not only did he hold on to the ball, securing the points that would prove to be the difference in the game, he got right up, spiked the ball Gronk-styles and jogged to the sideline. It hurt just watching that play but if Brady was affected, no one either in Gillette Stadium or watching the game on TV knew it. Now, bearing that in mind, Brady pretty much sucked otherwise, just as he said on the podium after the game. He routinely missed open receivers. He was skittish and happy footed at times. He threw two interceptions and had two other ones nullified by penalties. His fourth quarter pick, one play after Brandon Spikes made one of the plays of the game, on which he needlessly forced a bomb into double coverage (intended for Matthew Slater of all people) was something you would never in your wildest dreams imagine seeing him do let alone in the fourth quarter of the AFC Championship with a three-point lead. He finished 22-of-36 for 239 yards (6.6 YPA), zero TDs (the first time that’s happened in the playoffs since the 2002 AFC Championship game in Pittsburgh) and the two picks, all good for a woeful 57.5 passer rating. He was outplayed by Ravens QB Joe Flacco (??!!). But hey, the Pats won and if we know Brady,, who tied Joe Montana for the most post-season wins by a QB of all time, this performance will motivate him to no end come Feb. 5. Let’s chalk this one up to a fluke, an aberration, a one-time thing. There’s still no one Pats fans would rather have.\n",
            "Running Backs: BGreen-Ellis was a big factor all day despite splitting reps almost completely evenly with Danny Woodhead. It was a vintage, head down, straight ahead running kind of day for the Law Firm, who pounded his way to 68 yards and a TD on 15 carries. On one play, he got his helmet completely twisted around and ripped off, forcing him to go to the ground coconut unprotected, yet another display of the team’s overall toughness Most of the Pats success running the ball came on draws out of the shotgun with the Ravens D spread out and expecting the pass; the more traditional stuff was swallowed up with relative ease. But Benny did his part and then some. Woodhead was quiet save for once nice draw and Aaron Hernandez failed to replicate his monstrous efforts out of the backfield from the Divisional round win over Denver. And our binky Stevan Ridley sat this one out after fumbles in consecutive games, though given the Pats opponent in the Super Bowl, the New York Giants, he will likely be needed. The Giants have a ferocious pass rush and the Pats would be wise to run the ball a healthy amount in order to help neutralize it. On Sunday, Benny looked like he’ll be up to that challenge.\n",
            "Wide Receivers: B-This one was mostly the Wes Welker show again, with Deion Branch making two catches for 18 yards and everyone else doing mostly nothing (Julian Edelman caught one pass for eight yards). Welker had a couple of missteps (one drop, one slip, one deflection that turned into a pick that was luckily wiped out by a penalty) but was still his usual, dependable self. He finished with six catches for 53 yards, got the snot beaten out of him once again and naturally, a couple of his grabs resulted in enormously important first downs. At this point, as has been the case for several weeks now, Welker pretty much is the receiving corps. Any time Branch can put up an effort like last week against the Broncos (three catches, 85 yards, that amazing, 61-yard TD), it’s a bonus. This is Welker’s group. Everyone else (except Chad Ochocinco who may as well get cut before the Super Bowl if for no other reason than that he’ll be a distraction on Media Day getting asked over and over again why he is so awful, he doesn’t even dress for the biggest game of the year) is just renting.\n",
            "Tight Ends: B+Not quite the usual game-breaking day for A-Herb or Rob Gronkowski but solid nonetheless. Once again, the focal point of the Pats offense, they combined for 12 catches and 153 yards, though neither of them found the end zone. Gronk, who suffered a rough looking ankle injury late in the game but returned after missing just nine snaps, was immense in other areas than just catching the ball as he often is, at one point absolutely destroying Ravens pass rushing demon Terrell Suggs while staying home to block. And his first play back after leaving because of that ankle? He’s throwing a key block on Brady’s TD leap. These two guys are monsters, as we all know. But now that we’ve reached the final game, the biggest game, maybe we should look at them in the bigger picture. The bottom line is, in an amazing, exhilarating season filled with major moments and major performances, Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez have become the most important cogs in the Pats offensive machine whose names are not Tom Brady. And they’re both just in their second year. Unbelievable.\n",
            "Offensive Line: AHave to hand it to Matt Light; in what is probably the best season of his career, he just keeps getting better and better. Every week, it seems, there’s some stud, maniac pass rusher on his side and every week, that stud, maniac pass rusher is rendered an afterthought. On Sunday, it was Suggs, who had 14 sacks during the regular season and has garnered some sincere talk about being named Defensive Player of the Year. Against Light, he had two tackles. Period. That’s two. No sacks. Maybe once, he got within a yard and a half of Brady. And that’s it. The O-line is the core of this team and on Sunday, it stepped up and then some. And not just Light, either. Brian Waters, the best free agent signing this team has made in quite some time, was tasked with bottling up Ravens nose man Haloti Ngata and did just that. Logan Mankins once again shook off his late season knee injury to play a complete, spotless game. Nate Solder had the only blemish, getting beaten to the outside and allowing Baltimore’s only sack to someone named Paul Kruger, not exactly one of the Ravens big names on D. It was a fantastic performance and one that will certainly need to be duplicated in the Super Bowl against the Giants pass rush. The O-line’s inability to handle that same front four in Super Bowl XLII was one of the biggest reasons the Pats lost that game. If Sunday against the Ravens similarly fearsome D is any indication, this time around, this group will be ready.\n",
            "DEFENSE: B+Defensive Line: AAnyone out there own a Vince Wilfork jersey? Cause I’ll buy it off you. That’s how valuable that thing has to be after Sunday. Wilfork, one of the best, most important Pats of the past decade, played the game of his life against the Ravens, making plays against the run and the pass, wreaking havoc and at one crucial point late in the fourth quarter, single-handedly taking over. On the Ravens second to last possession of the night, with a third-and-3 from his team’s 30, he blasted through the line to wrap up Baltimore’s star back Ray Rice with one arm, dragging him to the turf with one arm for a three-yard loss (a massive stupid play call by the Ravens by the way, but that’s another conversation). The Ravens then decided to go for it rather than try a 50-yard field goal (a decision that obviously makes a hell of a lot of sense now), so Big Vince simply steamrolled center Matt Birk right into Flacco’s grill, taking the QB to his knees while still carrying the giant O-lineman, forcing Flacco to lob the ball to no one and turn the ball over on downs. It was the most dominant sequence any Pats defensive player has displayed in ages when you factor in the situation and circumstances. And it’s fitting that Wilfork, one of the longest tenured, core members of the organization, was responsible for it. And that’s not even getting into some of the stuff he did earlier in the game, which he ended with the following stat line: six tackles, three for a loss, one sack, and another hit on the QB. And he did it all while missing just three of 73 snaps. Outstanding. Everyone else up front played well too; Mark Anderson got pressure on Flacco a fair amount of times and played the run well. Brandon Deaderick plugged up space and both Gerard Warren and Kyle Love played roles in holding Rice, who came in leading the league in total yards from scrimmage, to just 67 yards on 22 carries and only one catch for 11 yards. When this group plays this well and is able to physically overmatch its opponent, it takes so much pressure off of the secondary and makes life easier for everyone. It’s hard to imagine them doing that any better than they did on Sunday.\n",
            "Linebackers: BGood for Brandon Spikes. He’s still working his way back from that knee injury suffered against the Giants the last time they played the Pats, but man are his fresh legs a wonder. He made nine tackles on Sunday, a huge part of the defense slowing down the Rice and the Ravens rushing attack. But his finest moment, as well as what was for about three minutes the play of the game, came on a passing play. Spikes intercepted a fourth quarter Flacco pass by simply staying in his land, trailing the tight end as underneath help for the safety and making an awesomely athletic play, extending one of his big paws just enough to snag the darted throw and reel it in. It was a sensational interception; not only did it come out of almost nowhere and was it such a cool display of athleticism, but the timing was perfect. It’s great to see Spikes make plays like that when he gets to stay on the field in passing situations. He’s getting closer to becoming an all-around backer. If he can stay healthy and out of trouble, watch out. Jerod Mayo was solid, not great and that seems to be his M.O., which is OK. He made a couple of big hits and looked very impactful at times yet was doing the chasing, flailing thing a couple times too. It was a mostly typical day for him. And Rob Ninkovich continued to be the second coming of Mike Vrabel; he got to Flacco once (along with James Ihedigbo) and was great against the run, combining with Anderson to do good work taking away the edges. And Dane Fletcher was active and aggressive in limited time. The Pats defense is healthy and coming together at the most opportune time possible. The linebacking corps is no exception.\n",
            "Defensive Backs: A-Go ahead, try to start an argument on this one. If you think that more attention should be paid to Flacco playing one of the best games of his career (22-of-36, 306 yards, two TDs, 95.4 passer rating) and torching the secondary down the stretch than to Sterling Moore’s two season-saving plays, more power to you. Because if Moore hadn’t knocked away a sure TD pass to Lee Evans on Baltimore’s second to last defensive play of the day (a play on which Evans was completely complicit) or broken up what would have been a first down throw to tight end Dennis Pitta on the next play, we wouldn’t be having this little chat. Moore was almost as much a hero on this day as Wilfork and more power to him. He’s yet another one of Belichick’s collection of undrafted, unheralded, never-heard-of DBs who rose above the rest of them to become one of the biggest reasons this team is going to the Super Bowl. Gotta love it. Things were OK elsewhere despite the yardage totals and the Ravens success on third down (nine of their last 14); Patrick Chung wore the goat horns on a 42-yard pass play to Ravens deep threat Torrey Smith. Kyle Arrington missed a chunk of time with an eye injury, but was pretty good. Devin McCourty saw more time at safety and also could share some blame on that throw to Smith (as well as a 29-yard catch and run for a TD also by Smith) but managed to make it through another week without humiliating himself. Ihedigbo had that sack with Ninkovich on a nifty, delayed blitz and added eight tackles including one for a loss. And Edelman got matched up with the Ravens best receiver Anquan Boldin, and was burned more than once but completely lucked out that Baltimore’s offensive coaches were too stupid recognize the matchup until the final five minutes. It’s going to be interesting to see how this group deals with the Giants receivers, two of whom (Hakeem Nicks and Victor Cruz) are absolute studs (and for the purposes of this discussion, let’s say interesting means terrifying). But we’ll worry about that next week. For now, let’s continue to celebrate Moore. What a couple of huge, huge plays. Hallelujah.\n",
            "Special Teams: CYikes. In what could have been a disaster, Woodhead fumbled a kick return at his own 30 following a long Ravens TD drive that gave them their first lead of the game. Luckily for him, the Pats defense came up with one of its best, stiffest stops of the evening afterward, keeping the Ravens from a first down and forcing them into a field goal that made the game 20-16, setting the stage for the Pats to reclaim the lead on their next possession. There was Woody again on the ensuing kick, running another one back, which was a big surprise, especially seeing as how Ridley had been banished for his fumble-itis and neither of those were half as costly. Anyway, it was a huge bullet dodged. The Pats have been pretty much nowhere in their return game all year but have gotten away with it. You have to wonder if Woody will be back there again next Sunday in Indy. As for the kicking game, Stephen Gostkowski was 3-for-3 on field goals and only had one kickoff returned all day and our man Zoltan blasted two punts for an average of just under 50 yards per. Job well done.\n",
            "Coaching: B+Maybe this grade should be a bit lower. Some of the play calling, particularly down the stretch, was questionable and that’s being friendly. The bomb to Slater made little sense at the time, even less so when it was picked off. And when the Pats got the ball back following the Ravens failed, fourth down conversion attempt, they went three-and-out with a chance to salt the game away, with a couple of real head-scratchers (a toss play to Benny on 2nd and 4?) included. But in the end, this grade is a testament to how ready Belichick had this defense ready to play. The Pats were on their heels on defense all year but allowed just 30 points in two playoff games and had guys making plays everywhere both weeks. There may not have been too many name guys out there, especially in the secondary, but they were Belichick’s guys, tough guys, guys who took his coaching and got better every single week. And now, the Pats have won 10 straight games and are going back to the Super Bowl. It’s pretty unreal. We could harp some more on the play-calling. Or we could do a comparison with the coaching on the Ravens sideline (so so poor in the fourth quarter in so many ways that it warrants its own 3,000 word column). But why bother? This season was arguably the best job of Belichick’s career. Let’s just leave it at that.\n",

            "The other I saw while there was the absolute mugging that Wes Welker gets, esp. when the ball doesn’t come his way. I think the refs are afraid to make a call away from the ball in the post season, and it really hurts us. Several plays I would see Welker get completely wrapped up a good 10 yds downfield. Reminds me of the 2001 Pats and what they did to the Rams receivers, only getting called the once on McGinnest. That has me worried.\n",

            "Danny Woodhead is learning the kick-off return role and is a work in progress. One fumble in that capacity does not a failure make. Danny will learn from it and make the needed adjustment. It is obvious that the coaching staff has great confidence in Woody in that they put him right back in the same position for a nifty and sizeable return. That speaks highly of Danny’s abilities to run the ball back in the maze of 11 defenders whose sole purpose is to destroy you. Even the fumble return was a significant gain before the ball was pulled out of his grip. Danny is improving in that role game by game, so quit the rush to judgment Jeremy and loosen up……Jeremy, you did not speak postively of Danny as a running back either. How could you when Obrien stupidly keeps running Danny up the gut all year long- i.e. 6 times against the Ravens. Danny is not an up-the-gut buster or Law Firm clone as Obrien seems to think and tries to make him. Danny is a lethal perimeter runner and short pass receiver, and has been used in neither of his gifted capacities since the playoff loss to the Jets last year when Obrien dumbly ran him up the middle ad nauseum. It didn’t work and the Pats lost. The 928 yard, 6 touchdown Danny Woodhead of 2010-11 has all but disappeared in 2011-12 because Obrien gut busts him and seldom if ever has Brady making passes to him……Jeremy, what you should be asking yourself is how can it be that the lethal replacement for Kevin Faulk last year could be reduced to such sub-parness and non-lethality this year. The answer is Bill Obrien,and the tragic wasting and misuse of Dannhy Woiodhead will not stop until Obrien is finally in Happy Valley.\n",

            "I watched the TV copy last night and it looked to me like Brady was just a bit off. I didn’t see him feeling paranoid about the rush, like we’ve seen a handful of times over the years. There were throws like the one to a wide-open Gronk, the one he led Hernandez too much down the seam and the one behind Welker that was picked. The throw seemed rushed because he felt he need to thread the needle, more than he was concerned about getting hit. The one to Gronk in particular he had no rush and seemed more shocked that Reed bit on the fake, that he rushed it too much.\n",
            "LikeLike\n",
            "This season is playing out exactly like the 2006 Colts season.  The Colts ran up their usual 12-4 record, but nobody took them seriously all year because of their defense.  But then the playoffs came around and the defense began making more plays than the offense.  People are getting on Brady for his statistically bad game vs. Baltimore, but miss the fact that he made huge, game winning plays.  Manning had the same criticism in 2006 and actually had his worst postseason of his career (if you go by numbers).  Seriously, look at the scores of their 4 playoff games.  Not Manning/Colts-like at all.  Again, Manning made “winning” plays when he had to that year.\n",
            "I believe it’s playing out the same way for the Patriots, with the much maligned defense STILL getting no respect.  With the opponent supposedly having a “ferocious” and “unstoppable” defense (Bears in 2006, Giants now).  Mark my words, the Pats D will end up making more plays in the Super Bowl and the MVP will come from the Defense.\n",
