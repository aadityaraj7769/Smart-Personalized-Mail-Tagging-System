eu mulls nuclear-free future, tests on reactors europe is considering "stress testing" its nuclear power stations to check they can cope with crises, while its energy chief on tuesday even raised the prospect of a nuclear-free future. eu mulls nuclear-free future, tests on reactors europe is considering "stress testing" its nuclear power stations to check they can cope with crises, while its energy chief on tuesday even raised the prospect of a nuclear-free future. The European Union (EU) has decided to conduct "stress testing" of its nuclear power stations to ensure they can withstand major accidents or crises. The EU's decision to conduct stress testing is in response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, which highlighted the need for more robust safety measures in the nuclear industry. The stress testing exercise will involve simulating extreme scenarios, such as earthquakes, floods, and cyber attacks, to assess the resilience of the nuclear power stations. The stress testing exercise will be carried out in collaboration with the European Nuclear Safety Guidebook (ENSG), which provides guidelines for the safe operation of nuclear power plants. The EU's Energy Chief, Kadri Simson, has suggested that the EU may consider a nuclear-free future, although she did not provide a timeline for such a transition. The EU's nuclear energy policy is currently under review, with a focus on ensuring a safe, secure, and sustainable energy supply for its citizens. The exercise is expected to be completed by the end of 2022, and the results will be used to inform the development of new safety standards for nuclear power stations in the EU. The EU has also launched a public consultation on the future of nuclear energy in the bloc, which will run until the end of 2022.

Extend this short-text with the same context and information to a full-length article (at least 1500 words) and explore the following points: - the background of the deal between bp and rosneft - the terms of the deal - the reasons for the collapse of the deal - the impact of the deal's collapse on bp and rosneft - the implications of the deal's collapse for the arctic oil industry - the possible future developments in the arctic oil industry - the potential opportunities and challenges for other oil groups in the arctic region Introduction: In a surprise move, BP's plan to gain a foothold in Russia's offshore Arctic oilfields through a deal with state-controlled Rosneft has collapsed. Impact of the deal's collapse on BP and Rosneft: The collapse of the deal is a major setback for BP, which had been hoping to gain a foothold in the Russian Arctic oil industry. Background of the deal: In May 2017, BP and Rosneft signed a deal that would have seen BP take a 20% stake in Rosneft's Arctic assets, including the Prirazlomnaya oil platform and the Khatanga and Tommot fields. The deal, which was announced in May 2017, aimed to combine BP's Arctic expertise with Rosneft's vast resources in the region. For Rosneft, the collapse of the deal may be seen as a missed opportunity to partner with a major international oil company. The deal's collapse will likely have a significant impact on BP's operations in the region, as it will have to reassess its strategy and find alternative ways to expand its presence in the Arctic. Terms of the deal: Under the terms of the deal, BP would have paid Rosneft $1.5 billion for its stake in the Arctic assets. However, the deal's collapse may also have implications for Rosneft' However, the deal has now fallen through, opening the way for other oil groups to try to fill BP's place. The deal was seen as a major breakthrough in BP's efforts to expand its operations in the Arctic, where it has been active since the 1990s. The deal also included a number of joint ventures between the two companies, including the development of new oil fields and the expansion of existing production facilities.

'tomatoland': not all tomatoes are created equal barry estabrook is the author of 'tomatoland: how modern industrial agriculture destroyed our most alluring fruit.' 'tomatoland': not all tomatoes are created equal barry estabrook is the author of 'tomatoland: how modern industrial agriculture destroyed our most alluring fruit.' In his book "Tomatoland: How Modern Industrial Agriculture Destroyed Our Most Alluring Fruit," Barry Estabrook explores the unintended consequences of industrial tomato farming and the importance of preserving the genetic diversity of heirloom tomatoes. Tomatoland: How Modern Industrial Agriculture Destroyed Our Most Alluring Fruit Tomatoes are one of the most popular vegetables in the world, with over 180 million metric tons produced globally every year. However, the rise of industrial agriculture has had a profound impact on the quality and flavor of tomatoes, leading to a loss of biodiversity, soil degradation, and the homogenization of taste. Homogenization of Flavor The industrialization of tomato farming has led to a homogenization of taste. The Rise of Industrial Agriculture In the mid-20th century, the tomato industry shifted from small-scale, family-owned farms to large-scale commercial operations. In contrast, heirloom tomatoes, which are grown using traditional farming methods, maintain a wider range of genetic diversity, ensuring a more robust and resilient crop. Modern commercial tomatoes are bred for high yields, disease resistance, and shelf life, rather than flavor or nutritional value. These advancements allowed for increased production and lower costs, making tomatoes more accessible to consumers worldwide. Loss of Biodiversity The homogenization of tomato varieties has resulted in a loss of genetic diversity. Modern commercial tomatoes are bred for their uniformity, with little attention paid to flavor diversity.

In conclusion, Israeli officials are planning to confront President Obama with their perception that he does not understand the realities of the Middle East during his visit to Israel next week. "The president does not understand the reality in the Middle East," one Israeli official was quoted as saying. According to Israeli media reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials are planning to tell Obama that he needs to "wake up" to the realities of the region, which they say he has been ignoring. Israeli officials have been privately grumbling for months about President Barack Obama's lack of understanding of the realities of the Middle East, and now they are set to confront him directly during his visit to Israel next week. They believe that Obama has been too focused on his domestic agenda and has not paid enough attention to the complex realities of the Middle East. "The president has been too busy with his own domestic issues to pay attention to the realities of the region," another Israeli official was quoted as saying. While the message is likely to be received with skepticism by the Obama administration, the Israeli officials believe that it is The officials reportedly plan to tell Obama that he cannot solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through empty promises and empty words, and that he needs to take a tougher stance against Iran and its proxies in the region. The Israeli officials' message is likely to be received with skepticism by the Obama administration, which has long maintained that it is committed to a comprehensive peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. The officials reportedly plan to use Obama's visit to Israel next week to drive home their message, which they say is long overdue. "We need to tell him that he cannot solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with a wave of his hand, and that he needs to take a tougher stance against Iran and its proxies." However, the officials believe that Obama needs to be told in no uncertain terms that his approach has not been working, and that he needs to take a more active role in the region to achieve peace. They believe that Obama needs to be pushed to take a more active role in the region and to take a tougher stance against Iran and its proxies.

The European Union's finance ministers urged Portugal on Saturday to commit to reforms and defended the region's austerity steps as tens of thousands of European workers protested in Budapest against spending cuts. Portugal has been under pressure to implement more austerity measures after its economy contracted by 1.8% in the second quarter, compared to the same period last year. The call for more austerity measures in Portugal came as the country's economy remains weak and the government struggles to meet its deficit targets. "Portugal has to do more to consolidate its public finances and to implement structural reforms to boost growth and job creation," said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the Eurogroup, the EU's currency bloc. Dijsselbloem said that while Portugal has made progress in reducing its budget deficit, more work needs to be done to ensure the country meets its targets and to restore confidence in the economy.

The two drugmakers had announced their plans to form the joint venture in May 2009, with the goal of creating a global leader in the $3 billion veterinary medicine market. The joint venture had been expected to tap into this growth by leveraging the strengths of both Merck and Sanofi-Aventis, two of the largest players in the industry. According to sources close to the situation, Merck and Sanofi-Aventis were unable to reach an agreement on key terms, including the ownership split and the management structure of the joint venture. The companies have stated that they will continue to invest in and develop new products for animal health, either independently or through other partnerships. The collapse of the deal is seen as a setback for the veterinary medicine industry, which has been growing rapidly in recent years due to increasing demand for animal health products.

states slash $1.8 billion in mental health funds since 2009 and more cuts could be coming in the future. states slash $1.8 billion in mental health funds since 2009 and more cuts could be coming in the future. Since 2009, state governments have collectively cut $1.8 billion from their mental health budgets, with more cuts potentially on the horizon. In conclusion, the cuts to mental health funding in the United States are a pressing concern. The current state of mental health funding in the United States is a cause for concern. By cutting funding for mental health services, states are exacerbating these inequalities and making it more difficult for these populations to receive the care they need. Moreover, the cuts to mental health funding can have a ripple effect, leading to decreased funding for other social services, such as education and healthcare. Furthermore, the cuts to mental health funding have disproportionately affected vulnerable populations, such as children, low-income families, and communities of color. This drastic reduction in funding has resulted in a significant decrease in the availability of mental health services, particularly in rural areas and low-income communities. The long-term effects of reduced mental health funding can have far-reaching consequences, including increased rates of substance abuse, suicide, and crime. In light of these consequences, it is essential that state governments prioritize mental health funding and take steps to increase access to services. By taking a proactive approach to mental health funding, states can help ensure that individuals and communities have access to the care they need to thrive. This can include increasing funding for mental health clinics, expanding Medicaid coverage for mental health services, and implementing policies that address the social determinants of mental health. The consequences of these cuts are far-reaching and can have a profound impact on the mental health of individuals and communities. The consequences of these cuts are far-reaching and have a profound impact on the mental health of individuals and communities. By prioritizing mental health funding and taking steps to increase access to services, state governments can help ensure that mental health is treated with the importance it deserves. These populations are more likely to experience mental health issues due to systemic inequalities and lack of access to resources. Additionally, the closure of mental health facilities in rural areas has left many individuals without access to essential services. For example, many mental health clinics have been forced to reduce their staff, limiting the number of patients they can treat.

Qatar has pulled out of the effort to mediate an end to Yemen's political crisis, blaming the country's embattled president for the impasse. According to the foreign ministry statement, Qatar's efforts to mediate a ceasefire and political settlement in Yemen have been "unsuccessful due to the lack of seriousness and goodwill shown by the Houthi militias." The withdrawal of Qatar from the mediation effort is likely to further complicate the already dire humanitarian situation in Yemen. The move comes after months of efforts by Qatar to broker a peace deal between Yemen's warring parties, including the internationally recognized government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and the Iran-backed Houthi rebels. The withdrawal of Qatar from the mediation effort is likely to make it even more difficult to reach a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The statement added that Qatar would continue to support the legitimate government of President Hadi and work with international partners to find a peaceful solution to the crisis. However, Qatar has now concluded that the Houthi side is not serious about reaching a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The situation in Yemen remains dire, and the international community must continue to work towards finding a peaceful solution to the crisis.

arizona governor rejects bid to loosen gun rules the governor also rejected a controversial bill that would have required presidential candidates to produce proof of citizenship. arizona governor rejects bid to loosen gun rules the governor also rejected a controversial bill that would have required presidential candidates to produce proof of citizenship. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey has rejected a bill that would have loosened the state's gun laws, just days after a mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead and dozens injured. The rejection of the bill comes as a setback for gun rights advocates in Arizona, who have been pushing for looser gun laws in the state for several years. The bill, which was passed by the Arizona legislature last week, would have allowed people to carry concealed weapons without a permit, as long as they were at least 21 years old and not prohibited from owning firearms. The governor's office released a statement on Monday saying that Ducey would not sign the bill, which would have allowed people to carry concealed weapons without a permit. The rejection of the bill comes as a surprise to many, as Ducey has been a strong supporter of gun rights in the past. "I cannot in good conscience sign a bill that would make it easier for individuals to carry concealed weapons without proper training and vetting. The safety of Arizonans and all Americans is of the utmost importance, and I will not compromise that safety for the sake of political ideology." However, it remains to be seen how Ducey's decision will impact the broader gun control debate in the United States, as many other states are also considering similar bills. However, in the wake of the El Paso shooting, Ducey appears to have had a change of heart, citing concerns about public safety and the potential for more gun violence.

Arab league delays summit by year to march 2012 An Arab League summit originally planned for March this year has been delayed by 12 months at the request of its host, Iraq, Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa told Reuters on Thursday. The new date for the summit has not yet been set, but Moussa said the Arab League would work with Iraq to find a suitable time. Despite the delay, the Arab League summit is expected to be an important event in the region, bringing together leaders from across the Middle East and North Africa to discuss regional issues and work towards greater cooperation and stability. The summit was scheduled to take place in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, but Iraq asked for more time to prepare for the event, Moussa said. The Arab League summit was expected to bring together leaders from across the Middle East and North Africa to discuss regional issues, including the ongoing conflict in Syria and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The delay comes as Iraq continues to recover from years of conflict and political instability, including the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003 and the ongoing fight against Islamic State (IS) militants. The delay is seen as a sign of the challenges facing Iraq as it tries to rebuild and stabilize after years of conflict.
